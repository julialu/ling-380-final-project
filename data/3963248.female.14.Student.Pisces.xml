       I decided on something crimson for a new layout, because I like a blood-red journal, 'k?      I missed the Bake Off Night because I didn't have anything to bring. It's sorta my fault. *messed up everything*

       Since my  urlLink friend  has a Blog, I decided using this besides my  urlLink LJ ...not that I'll stop using my LJ, I mean, I got Cure communities to talk in there.    Today was a good sermon. It was a bit strong, you know, on the matters of sexual purity and immorality. But it was really good.    My sister thinks Dean is a weird guy who laughs at everything. He is weird, but in a good way. I mean, I can talk too much and he won't stop me. Hehe...maybe I do talk too much. XD    I just started downloading a bunch of new songs from church, like "Draw Me Close" and "Refiner's Fire."    Now for more Web-surfing!

        Hello again.  I made my Livejournal blue. There is an annoying rant about it there.  I went to the mall and to Target today. I saw a t-shirt at Hot Topic...it was The Cure. *heehee* I also saw their latest album at Target. I bought makeup at Target...and my sisters got Unreal Tournament 2004. *They own your sorry behind.*
