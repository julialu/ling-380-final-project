       urlLink     i always wished to live behind a waterfall...it's a magic curtain and a secret world hides on the other side...that's where i would live. on the other side in a cave house with soft green moss carpet and i would have jars filled with lovely things- dreams and wishes and secrets in jars.

       bleed,    lover.    bleed into my soul   and    feel    me    breathe, feel me sigh    into your arms    and let me live    forever;   a light   dancing in your eyes   while we watch them fall away.   while we watch them fall away.

        last week i was terribly worried for the boy from my art class who told me he just didn't have the capacity to care anymore because his friends didn't like him and his girlfriend was angry and he might as well die. i stopped all i was doing and tried in vain to console him, but he was determined to be miserable. at night i thought about his pain and i felt helpless and useless and scared for this poor boy.         yesterday i went to see my friend who's in the hospital on the restricted floor. after disinfecting i donned a pair of gloves, made sure the outer door was shut, then went in to see him. i couldn't give him the stickers i brought because his quarantine is so strict.    pale and bald he lay in his bed drifting in and out of consciousness while the nurse hooked the tube coming out of his chest to a bag of blood. day seven, it said on the bulletin board. day seven of his chemo. "Only three to five more weeks. Well, unless he gets infected again."        so, sorry art boy, it really is a shame that your girlfriend's upset, but this week i'm more worried for my friend whose blood is trying to kill him.   get your head out of your ass and realize that there's real pain in this world. don't put yourself in danger- there are some who don't have a choice.

       where are you when i need you?    why am i alone?    why aren't you here?    were you ever here    or was i sleeping with a ghost?      you came at times when i felt like   i could be anything.   you came when i was at my best   and you could hear me sing.      but now the sky is cloudy   and my window is wide open,   you've disappeared   -mist in the air-   while i lie here cut and broken.

       talk about me,    dis me,    try to make me feel bad.    i know you're jealous for what you never had.     don't condemn me for a feeling you don't understand.     it's not like it was something that i could have planned.    you're just not open,   you're just too cold.   you're not the one that i should have told.   go ahead and laugh with your creepy boyfriend   i'm the one who will be happy in the end.   no, i'm NOT like you;   i don't want to be.   i have more magic because i am free.

       on the ground    like an insect    unable to    dry    my    wings.      watch you fly-    spinning and twirling;    oblivious to    what    you    have.      i'm still here,    walked right by.    i'm still here and still can't fly.    take me    take me with you.   higher, higher,    away from all i know.       or was i born to be an echo?   echo, echo.    born to be an echo, nothing more.

       twisted in pain,    you're far away.    nothing i can say;   you won't listen anyway.       sleep tonight darling, forget the trouble.    sleep tonight darling and remember what you've had.    sleep hard tonight darling,    slip into the otherworld.    how do i console a fellow on the edge?       taking in demons and angeldust,    swallowing pain and an urge to scream.    pierce my heart    with your eyes,    take it out on the weak.       push me off and fall on your own.    wander away alone through the hate.    alone by choice... at your own risk.    don't cry about the world you create.         not a victim in my eyes...

       studs and eyeliner and dyed hair...a costume. i don't see a person at all.      "damn the man! down with the system!" does he know that hot topic's in the MALL? if he spent more time developing his personality he wouldn't have to shop for one around the corner from build-a-bear.      he's lost. with such a strong appearance his inside and outside are totally seperate...it's like he's got two lives. does he need these accessories to make up for something he feels he's lacking? he uses hair product and chains and black nail polish to define himself as an individual, but if he took it all off he'd see that his mind and personality are powerful enough to set him apart.      diversity is what makes life beautiful, but relying on objects to make you stand out is weak. to be a real rebel, try letting go.

       here i am expecting just a little bit   too much from the wounded.   but i see through it all   and see you.   so i threw you the obvious   to see what occurs behind the eyes of a fallen angel,   eyes of a tragedy.    oh well.   apparently nothing.   you don't see me.   you don't see me at all.      -a perfect circle          look up directly up   see the disappearing sun   golden light illuminating   dust and strands of spiderweb   pollen seeds feathers leaves   falling floating through the air   warming cool water   deep green moss to golden velvet   rushy bracken- a gilded fan   consumed, lost, spinning   am i really here?

           tonight i feel lost and tonight i feel lonely      i remember      he looked at me with crystal eyes and i didn't know what to do. immediately my flutter-heart got twitchy and my head spun but i lay still, hiding from deadly emotion. so pretty like a delicate creature i wanted to capture but didn't want to crush, he was beside me and he was sweet. next to him i felt transparent- like he could see through my skin, see everyone who'd been there before and i was afraid. would he understand? would he forgive?    i don't remember the others, i don't remember being afraid then because i wasn't. even if i was made of glass they'd never take time to look inside, take time to look at me.      but these crystal eyes (crystallize?) were fixed and searching in my soul. i was embarassed. did he see me, childish and unsexy? did he see me reading fairytales in the woods, moving to a new spot every twenty minutes as the sun moved? did he see the massive snarlballs that overtook my hair after months of living in the woods? could he see me knee deep in chilly pondwater, toes squished in the mud, mosquitos sucking my bare arms and legs, catching newts and touching their soft orange bellies?      he took my hand and i felt embarassed by the shiny pink polish i'd applied that afternoon but he held me anyway and it was nice. he was skinny and elbowy but his embrace was gentle and warm, better than all that lusty stuff i thought i enjoyed. this was real- it's what i remember now, and i miss him.
