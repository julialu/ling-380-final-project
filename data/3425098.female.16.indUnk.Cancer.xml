      Oh yeah! Hey everybody! It's the first day of summer!!!! YAY!! *cheers* And what does that mean? We all get to...SLEEP!! *does a happy dance* And this should mean the beggining of happiness, and the end of tourcher and suffering. WRONG. Ha, you thought you were getting away from it all. Not only can you no longer get away from your parents fury about the distruction of their "perfectly clean house", but sometimes the summer heat gets to people before it actually gets to the rest of us... Ahh...hanging out after school...no more pressure, no more rules...just a time to hang out and relax....No room at McDonald's? That's ok, we'll go to Wendy's. Eat, drink and be merry. No where to go? That's ok. There are friends who willingly open their homes to us. Drive, sing and yell at idiot drivers. (^-^) So we get to his house, and chill withsome of his friends. I enjoy being part of a group x2, and all around me, apparently, is chaos. Somehow, Jason almost broke up with Amanda, most of it is because of Michelle, and some of it me but I don't know what the hell's going on or what I did...Therefore, no known solution. People start missing. Jason and Alex are gone. Amanda, Michelle and Erin are off talking somewhere. So, what is there to do? Sit in his room and flip open and closed a pocket knife someone handed you, and watch the end to one of the stupidest movies you think you have ever seen with the main actor from Batman (whoever the hell that happened to be, I dunno...)  Drama, Bitching and fighting...And I don't know what's going on...Well, next thing I know, I see Jason in his truck slowly pull up to his house, and so I go out to greet him so I can get a hug, and maybe an explaination, since everyone else says it's none of my buisness...Ok...So he gets in reverse, drives back down the street, and turns the corner, and is off back home. To Plano. Now what the hell is going on that Jason would do that to me? The person he says is his little sister, and his Kitty no matter what happeneds? I wish I knew!!! But somehow, it's part my fault. Wish I knew...wish I knew... What to do then? With four of his friends left...Amanda, Michelle and Erin leave w/ Shawn...We go to look for a place to swim. Ok....No swimsuit...New pair of clothes to use. Noproblem. No pool. Someone's got a little Jacoosie (I hate that word...never knew how to spell it..) Ok...Dirty water. We'll just empty it and  re-fill it. Umm...dispite the small crawling things...Ok, 20 minutes of empting isn't bad. Let's fill it up. Alrighty...*thunder*..."Hey guys, I think it's going to rain..." "That's ok. It'll help us fill this up that much quicker"...Oh yeah, smooth...It pours from 6-10pm. *hiding in shed* "OK! I think it's almost full!!" "..." "You dumbass, it's freezing out there!! There is way too much wind to blow our nuts off!!" (there are 4 guys and one other girl besides me.) "Well, why don't we all just go back to my house and dry off?" (We all walked 5 minutes to get to this guys house.)  So, run throught the pouring rain to waiting arms with towels and dry clothes. Ahh....warmth...Glorious, glorious warmth...But soon, I have to go home, back in the rain...(damn, and I was just dry too...) Well, back home, listen/watch music videos from some of my fav. bands...can't sleep...Oh yes, it's just another day.  Wow....this is going to be a fun and exciting summer...Got a 90 on that project, and Ricky's still not talking to me...    ...And I'm still sick...

      Well, still working on that stupid project. 

22,May,2004


	 
      *heavy sigh* ....*looka around*...What? What are you looking at? Huh?! YOU WANNA PEICE OF ME,  PUNK!!!  ...So anyways...Really...I'm ok. Well, I'm still a lil tired from last night's party. But it was worth it. The past couple of days were hell, and I couldn't think of a better way to get things off of my mind than to go and spend some time with my other closest friends   and celebrate Jason's 18th B-day. I don't think I've ever seen Amanda so happy.  My eyes still sting from the tears shead over the past couple of days...I can't remember the last time I cried so much in 3 days...*slams head on desk* Stupid emotions...Damn them to hell. Anyways...Back to the party! Well, got to see my older bro Jason  . Amanda, Erin, Paul, Allen, Will got there after I left, Brett, Henry came, Michelle, her boytoy Shauwnie, Morgan of course considering it was her house, Hanna, Valan  , and maybe some other people, but I can't remember right now. But it was great. We swam most of the time, and I have a couple bruises from tripping while chasing Jason on slippery tiles after jumping out of the pool...Oh yeah...Not exactly one of my better or smarter ideas.  Well, on another happier topic, I finally got to talk to James again! No, not the jackass from my school, the one that's actually cool, and disappeared for about a month. Oh, I'm going to kill him. And he knows it. ^-^ Nah, I love him anyways.   Oh! But speaking of which, Something else happened last night that was kinda/very unexpected. Well, recently, I'd been talking to Henry again, and hanging out with him some more. Well, got a burn of some of his songs he did while he was still with his band about a year ago. ^-^ Much enjoyment. Especially since one of the songs was written about me...I'll have to get those lyrics up eventually...When I have time to type them. But anyways, beside the point to the fact that he asked me out at the party. Yeah, that was kinda unexpected. But I'm happier now, and I think things are going to do better this time.  Wow...Last night I had one of my most realistic dreams ever. So, I went to sleep about 12, knowing everything would turn out ok with everything...Dream...God that was weird...So, it went somewhere along the lines of me going home again, but feeling like it was the first time. I actually felt like it was real...not like it was a dream...because the things that happened could have actually happened. I don't remember as much at the moment...But it was like...I went to sleep...Then I was having a dream...A dream within a dream...Another reason I thought it was real. But then I knew that one had to be a dream...So I heard Ricky asking me if I would go out with him. Well, that was weird enough, I'm like, yeah, It's a dream. But he said it atleast 5 times, I'm like...Ok...What's going on? I woke up, and he was like hovering over me...watching me...And he started ranting/talking/depression monologe? about how I wouldn't answer him, so therefor I must not love him at all, and how everything I ever said was a lie. Well, Ricky is my best friend. Oh course I love him. So...It hurt...and I swore it was real...but I couldn't cry...And I don't really cry, but I felt like I was, but there were no tears...my throat hurt so much, no sound would come out...And he wouldn't hold me...I remember thinking how much I just wanted someone to hold me, and tell me everything was going to be alright...That it was really just a dream, even though I though I already woke up..But no one showed up...I know there was more to the dream, but that's what stuck with me...And then I really woke up with a sore throat, a cough, and burning eyes...Yeah, kinda freaked me out... But, it's all said and done, and I think I'm getting sick...fun stuff...

      So, there's a time and place to say the things you want to say. Sometimes, you just can't tell when to shut up...and others...You realize later that you missed your chance to say something that could only be said then and there, and you will never get the chance again. So, today's Sunday...a day of relazation...free from worry...Well, maybe for the rest of the world...But here in my room...Too much has happened over the past couple of days to even discribe...But hey! Might as well try, right? Oh God, where to start...So, it was Thursday during summer school, when our teacher was having us do bookwork the entire time we were there. That's a long time...So  said screw it, I have a high enough grade that it won't matter (then turned out that it didn't matter, cuz she didn't take them up, but got points for everyone we answered correct in class...stupid teacher...). So, I don't know why...but in the middle of drawing, I suddenly got really mad at Ricky again. About everything that happened, and everything that could happen...So I wrote in my spiral, like I would here, letting out steam. Normally, Iwrite things cuz I either don't know if I'm sure about how I feel, so i write it down so that the person doesn't hear it, and I didn't mean it. Or, i write things down cuz I'm just trying to get everything out of my mind so I don't blow up...especially on someone...So for three and a half pages, I wrote. I ranted and raved...and I swore to myself, that the next day, friday, I was going to fix things, but they could never be as they once were. I had finished it up before the day was over, and decided that the next day, I would take it home and type it to post here. Why is it not here? Stay tuned to find out!

      So? What's been going on in my life, you ask? Well, here you go... 

03,June,2004


	 
      Ok...So first you are pissed at me...Yesterday...Now you want to talk...tomorrow...What in the world is going on? Beats the heck outta me...Either way, we're off to see the wizzard soon enough. (Yes, yes...You all saw something coming...Ok, so you didn't. Deal with it. =P)

       Wednesday, June 02, 2004 I think this is funny...or maybe, its just me...and you know what, it might just be. Isn't it great how you care so much for a person, and that person in return lies to you? You want them so badly to pass, do good in like, HAVE A LIFE FOR PETE'S SAKE!...and they just don't care, and they say how much you sound like their mom. And then, you see who they run to. They go to people who don't care...who couldn't give a fuck if they passed or failed high school, if they lived in a card board box...isn't that just kind of starnge. I thought best friends were suppose to care for the other. Were suppose to what they in all aspects of life. And they just don't care. Well fine, you know what? I just don't give a rats ass anymore. She can go off, be in high school for the next 20 years for all I care. She can go off and have to sell herself on the streets to try and support herself. Because if shes going to pull shit like this...and all because I fucking yelled at her and shes failing. Then fine. She can. But you know what Kristen? Don't come running to me when your life is in pieces, cause you know what I'll do ? I'll get directly in your face and go...I told ya so.  # posted by Ryn Ryn @ 9:16 PM   Oh! Is  that what this has been all about? Well, thanks for telling me...Glad to know that's how you really feel about me...Or, both of you, since I'm sure that the two of you obviously feel the same way. Otherwise, you would not have agreed with him. What did I lie to you about? School? School has been over for a week now. Yes, I failed, and that's why I'm going to summer school. That, along with the fact that I can't stand not doing anything for days on end, so summer school is a good thing. And you know what? You can't blame me for not being in Plato. That was my mother's fault for not signing me up in time. I went, they sent me home. Well guess what. I'm back in it now, so you can shut up anytime now. I took care of it. And I don't know why you two are so freakin pissed off at me all the time now. Have I really turned into that bad of a person? Or are you just being that hipocritical? Because it doesn't make sense to me. Maybe it does to you...but I don't know what's going on in your head to make you hate me so much...again...  I thought we were past that stage...

       When people stop re-opening the wound...when they stop trying to make it bleed more...   How's life? Oh, just dandy, of course. *pulls knife out of back and throws it out of sight* Eh heh...So! Life. Let's talk about life. What is there really to your life but friends and family? Seems like all I've really got to live for. Don't have the motivation to bother with school, cuz I have nothing to push for. (Famous journalist, photographer, Marine Biologist...) I don't know what I want to do with my life, I don't know what I'm good at...I know some things I like to do...I like to draw. I like to write poetry. I like playing with small childeren. I like to help/be around animals. But what does any of this do to help me in life? Artist? Doubt it...Writer? Yeah, good luck there. You can surly live off of that salery...not...DayCare/PetCare Person? Oh yeah, you sure are mother's shining star...There's just no future in anything I seem to enjoy! My best friend is sure set to be a great graphical designer, or whatever it is that she can do...Me? I'm sure there is something... There has to be. But now what that is...I have no idea... But anyways, on the different matters. Well, I don't know if I had mentioned it earlier or not, because I don't remember the last topic I posted about...So, we'll just start from where my mind starts.  Well, Ricky is/was talking to me again. (don't quite know at the moment...) He came over and we talked, and everything seemed to be worked out. Well, now comes the big scandal that shouldn't be so big, if it wasn't for the fact that I was being played the whole time. Well, known or unknown, I was going to have Caryn and Ricky over two days ago...Monday. Well, so I knew Ricky was being dragged to the movies with his uncle and his brother. So, I told him he was welcome to come over afterwards. Or...encouraged. ^-^ Well, I talked to them both online early that morning. Went off for a sec, came  back and Caryn had left with unknown causes. Well, alrighty. She might have run off to go do things with her mother. It's only 10...She'll be back later. There's a possibility...Well, Ricky leaves at 12ish, and comes back about 5. "Hey! So how was your movie veiwing? Kinda long, wasn't it?" "Well, we saw two movies. Shrek2 and Van Helsing. But uh, I'm kinda busy at the moment. Can I call you back later?" "Sure! What are yoy doing?" "Oh, I'm just really tired, so I'm going to go take a nap. Call you when I get up?" "Sure thing." *2 hours later* "Hi, is Ricky there?" "No, he's out at the moment. He should be home soon."  *20 minutes later* "You called?" "Yeah,sleep well?" "Yeha, but still a lil tired." "Where'd ya go?" "Oh, no where." (You got to love flashbacks/re-inactments...Caryn doesn't show up online that night)  *next day after going to Ricky's and school, then not school...So around 5/6* "She lives! So where were ya yesterday?" "Oh, I went to the movies." "For that long? How many did ya see?" "Two." "Really? Thought you weren't much of a movie person?" "Eh, yeah well..." "So what did you see?" "Van Helsing and Shrek2." "Oh...did you have fun?" "yeah, somewhat..."  Hmm...I don't know if you caught that but...I did...*sighs* Not exactly thrilled... So how do you cover for yourself without saying that you ditched your "best friend" ? You find something to blame on them, or skip that step, and decide you are mad at them. Well, if that isn't what they are doing, then I did something w/o saying anything to make them upset. So, aparently I don't care anymore about anything...again. Well, what more do you want from me? I haven't said anything to be put against me, cuz you haven't said anything for me not to care about. And why would I not care? I don't think they realize how much they mean to me...The first two people who took me for who I was, accepted me, and cared for me. Now..Now I don't know what's going on. I don't know what game they are playing, or how the rules changed, but apparently I wasn't part of the deciding party. "Well, if you haven't gotten what it is by now, obviously you don't care enough to figure it out."  HOW DOES THAT WORK?!

      Plain and simple. People just need to shut up. I'm tired of dealing with all this crap. I'm tired of telling people that I know what they are going through, and this is how you can help yourself, and then be ignored. I try and help people, but then find that they didn't hear a word I said.&nbsp;I don't know what more I can do. When you go through this entire situation with your best friend, with her realizing every detail...And then she..?!!? Ack.... So as stated in earlier posts, bad things have been happening. At the moment, I'm refering to the entire ordeal with my two "Best Friends". Well, one of them is currently waiting for a court date because he "attempted assult" on me. Well, you'd think that would be enough of a hint to his "lover" that the guy wasn't all he was cut out to be. But no no no...You find out that not one week after, they have sex. Yes, that's right...My sweet little innocent friend, and my perfect loving guy. Match made in heaven, right? Hmm....Well maybe if he hadn't already asked ME if I wanted to do him as well!! Wait, what? Really? Oh yeah...What's what written on the ceiling? Dumbass? Gullible? WAY too trusting for my own good? Hmm...Maybe&nbsp; because he wasn't joking when he asked me, but he had already done her once or twice...Oh wait! No, it was three times! As of right before she came to my house to stay the night! WTF!?! For the love of god, I thought she would be smarter than that...Especially after him telling me that he still loves me, and tries to convince me that everything is going to be ok...Yeah sure. Translation? Why won't you fuck me? Seriously? Am I really that bad? What the hell?!!?! Oh my god! I can't believe I was that stupid! What else would to people do at one in the morning after sneaking a guy into her room? I mean, I didn't want to believe it, I know that. But seriously...I thought I had known&nbsp;her better than that! And him? How the hell could I have believed so many lies after everything that had happened?! You'd think I would also be the one to learn a lesson. Yes, you don't want to brag about it, but I'm supposed to be here for her. For anything. But as the best friend, I'm also supposed to try and keep you on the way you are supposed to be. Not let you fuck around with some guy that is going to get you seriously hurt!! I mean, my god! Sure I'm pissed off right now, or maybe more confused than anything, but if I didn't say any of this now, it would eventually blow up in someone's face that has no right in knowing. Ok, let's think about this...Sure having sex in high school isn't that uncommon, but it should be different with her. Why? I don't know...Maybe because I thought that she had more moral value than that! I love her to death, realy, truely I do...I just wish that she would have listened to me when I warned her! And I know that she's going to get hurt, and that she's going to fall. I will be there for her when she falls, but what am I supposed to say? I told you so? Oh yeah, that would be absolutley supportive and helping. And when she loses him, it's going to be even harder on her because of her "connection" with him. Because she refuse to let go, because she was "in love". Sure! Great! More power to ya. You want to be with this guy and have his children? That's wonderful, but NOT NOW! That's the whole point of waiting til you are grown and married!! Don't want to wait? You'd rather risk ruining your life? And what is he going to do? He's too unstable to be any good to the both of you. Sure he'll say that he loves you, but he doesn't even feel strong enough about himself and confedent enough to believe he can make it through High School! Yes, these years are full of stress, so why bother adding more?! I just wish I could make you see what I see. Make you see what you are doing to yourself, as well as other people. What you're doing to me...I know you don't. Because you don't want to. You used to be able to understand anything from every point of veiw. But now there is something that you want, don't want to lose, so why bother looking at the bad points? Yes, you are a horrible person. How dare you. You do all this, not caring of what happens, who you hurt, and you do it happily. Yeah, it means you've screwed up, but that doesn't make you a horrible person. What makes you a terrible human is not wanting to fix it. Not trying to make things better. That's where you've gone wrong. And the moment you stopped thinking that I cared about what happens to you and the choices you make...Is the day that you stopped truely listening to yourself and any common sence you have ever had...Maybe you should shut up and start listening again...

      Ok, so I'm detatching myself from reality for a moment. I'm tired of everything that is going on..Everything is happening all at once. Nothing is slowing down, and at this point, it can only get worse. The only escape is my books, and even that's only temperary...(BTW, I highly recomend The Hollow Kingdom, its sequeal, anything by Garth Nix, and The Silver Kiss.) My life has been...demeaned to living a life in faery tales, just to get away from what people call the real world...Beliving in a world where falling in love with a Vampire who is 300 years old, and trying to kill his brother so that he can live is an everyday thing...Where being stolen by goblins and marrying their King to keep their race from extinction and then finding you love him when his life is in danger and you are the only hope for a demon race you have come to know as your family is normal and completely ordinary...Not this world full of hate, pain, distain, fear, death...This can't be real...Why are people so willing to beleive in a world that isn't real before they believe in the pain and devestaion of this "perfect" world? Why is tragedy so much harder to understand and embrace? Why is it easier to believe when it's happening to someone else, but you want to think it's a dream when you find that you've stopped readin, and you are finally sitting back in your room, and this is all real...Not a bad dream...Nightmares can stay with you for as long as you want to remember, but reality...Reality is here forever, and there's nothing you can do about it. There is no fast forward button to press if you don't like how the movie's going...You can't just flip a couple pages to the end of the chapter...This is life, and there is no true way out...No real solution. You could end your life, but you would just be adding pages to someone else's chapter in their sob story...So what are people supposed to do when they are stuck, and they have no one to turn to...no one to talk to? Turn to God? Drugs? Self-Mutilation? But where does it all end up? One way or another, you are just adding pages to your chapter, and maybe even adding a chapter for the people around you. For some people, they are taking out chapters...Chapters of their life that they need to survive...And eventually, you have to realize there's nothing you cna do for them with out causing harm to yourself, so adding more pages to either of your books that you carry with you and clutch to your heart. People today still look for faery tale endings to their problems. Teenage girls and abused wives still look over the golden horizen waiting for their Prince Charming...Their Knight in Shining Armor. Some boys are praying that if they are kissed by the pretty princess, they can turn into something wonderful, instead of the frog they have come to believe they are. Small children wait up at night of the faeries to come take them away to the place of magic where Queen Mab dwells...There's no one to save the poor and unlucky from their misery...No one to right the wrongs that are all to frequent in this place we call home. Terror runs free, hearts are broken, lives distroyed...And sometimes there is no happy ending...The hero doesn't always survive while saving the princess if he even makes it that far...The good guy doesn't always want the girl...In war there is death...In life there is pain...And you may not a friend to the end who you can turn to for everything at anytime that you need. But though there will be an ending to your story one way or another...You can't always expect a happy trail to the end, but maybe a happy ending if you're lucky...

      This can not be happening...What the hell is going on?! First Ricky's gone off the coop again, and being pissy about god knows what...Monday I'm supposed to talk to the cops to drop the charges so that Ricky can get some help, not jail time...Two days ago, Paul got in a fight with his mom, and is now back at our house until we can deal with his parents...Today I was supposed to hang out with Jason because he had off work today, and I hadn't been able to hang out with him for weeks. But instead, I get a phone call from James' mother, asking me if I know where he is, because he has gone missing. I figured he would just be with jason, but apparently that wasn't possible because Jason had gotten into an accident the night before and was currently in the hospital. Wow, what?! When did this happen?! And why didn't  I   know about it!!?!! So now, no one has seen James since yesterday sometime, no one knows about what happened the night before...And it is just so messed up that everywhere I turn, it seems like it couldn't get any worse...Well, we could always find James not living anymore...wouldn't surprise me right now...What's next? How much worse could this day get?! I guess almost breaking down in the middle of Wendy's in the middle of lunch pales in comparison...What the hell is going on! This can't be happening...Now Jason's truck is wreaked because he let some  drunk  chick drive it and floor it through a red light...I don't know how he is, the chick is in a neck brace, I don't know who else was in the car, or how their conditions are, much less Jason's...And what about the people in the other car?! It was Jason's truck...It may not matter who the driver was...Jason my have to face either involentary man slaughter, or vehicular manslaughter just because it was  his  truck...I just don't know what to think...what to do...there is just nothing to say anymore...
