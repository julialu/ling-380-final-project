       urlLink     decided to start palying with the camera again.... i remembered seeing these cute weeds near amit's apartment.... i went there today n took a bunch of snaps...... 3 of them seemed ok... i have uploaded them in the "photlab" album (look at the "pictures" link on the right)  i've started to love using a small depth of feild... so that only a small part of the picture is in focus and everything else is blurred..... no better way to highlight the subject

       seem to be getting interested in too many things......   want to learn photography  want to read software design (i'll be really happy when i actually complete a book!)  want to write more software  want to read a lot of articles/opnions on technology  want to spend more time with friends  want to make more new friends  want to learn about movies n cinematography  want present a tech paper   naturally i was thinking that the biggest problem would be time........ strangely enuf, indecision has been the villian...... as soon as i get myself started one thing, i get tempted into doin somethin else...... and we all know the result..... another day wasted...... guess aruna was right when she said that the "c" in "karthik.c" stands for confused :-|   well atleast i managed to put an entry in the blog.... guess thats a start :-)

      just bought a new camera on e-bay this saturday...... still hasnt arrived yet. feeling pretty scared thinking about it, never bought anything this expensive online.  i have been getting more and more interested/passionate in photography in the past one year..... so ended up buying a very high end camera.... a  urlLink sony f828 .... dunno if its worth it.... but it surely does look cool :)  cant wait till i get my hands on it :-)  and also in other less interesting news.... i finally created my own weblog...... u can see it at  urlLink http://cantspellathing.blogspot.com/ . had to come up with some wierd name like this, coz most of the usual names are already taken. but it speaks a lot about me :-D
