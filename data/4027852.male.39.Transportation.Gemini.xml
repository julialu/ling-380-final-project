       urlLink    How many times have we heard it said, "Oh, Lord, give me a sign!" Alas, too often the reply is vague and ambiguous: the phone rings at an opportune time, a feather falls from out of the blue, a water stain appears that resembles a religious image. We all want to know if God exists; maybe He just needs a reliable method to let us know He's here.  urlLink  www.yo-god.com    urlLink

      Nothing much so far....i just have&nbsp;to take my camera, and&nbsp;fire away.&nbsp;&nbsp; Since i only got a little camera, i thought i would buy one of those SD memory card, i can only take 10 hi-res pictures at a time before having to give them to my computer, but&nbsp;no i won't take 70 low-low-res pictures like they say on the booklet.  This way i think, &nbsp;i can come up with very good pictures, what i realy like to look at and/or for you to look at.

      Doom 3 is out...after 4 years....long awaited game by many....but not by me, no sirrrry!!!! I've been burned realy hard with Unreal 2, not to be confused with any of the Unreal Tournament franchise. I mean Unreal 2, the sequel of Unreal...the father of all games....My 1st FPS(1st person shooter) Oh man i loved that game....so much!!! I even joined a clan. My name was (LPB)StalkerTheOne.....we were the low ping bastards!!! In those days cable use to rule the Internet, in my part of the neighbourhood....too many porn downloader got the best of me, then DSL came along.....Thank you very much!  -Back to Doom 3 now.......Unreal 2 was a big mistake....wanna know why???? They had the Magnificent idea of putting a so called "plot" into a FPS....what the hell is that?!?!?!?! I always made the comparaison with a porno movie....Is there a "plot" in a porno movie????? NOOOO It also goes for a FPS DAMIT!!!!!!!!!!!!! They destroy a realy good game by adding a plot to it.  Unreal 2 citation. Start citation here-----------
