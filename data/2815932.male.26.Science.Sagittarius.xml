      G'day, peeps  been trying to think of anything to put on here that I've not told you already  i've not managed to  So here's some stuff you know already!  The show for this year is Wizard Of Oz, pending getting the license. We can cast it no problems (touch wood), so we just need the final o-k-ya from the license holders... Heh heh... We rock... Show week is October 10th - 17th  Er  Residential weekend has now been booked, which was done last night after theatre group when nearly everyone said they'd want to go  Fantastic  So, to confirm, the dates for that are Friday April 30th, May 1st, May 2nd.  Should be a good one this year, as we're so plentiful in numbers, and we're just great  Lynn's cats haven't said if they want to go yet... ;)  So  anyway, see you next week, i'll post any more news as and when I gets it  cheers

      The script for the "other" version of Wizard of Oz has arrived, & so we can now look @ casting & stuff...  NB: DON'T ASK US ABOUT CASTING ALL THE SAME THO!!!  I'm being devious and putting in a code-word so I know who's been to visit... You can give me the code word when you next see me, or you can text me if you want, or email, or whatever... Up to you...  Code word is  "Sminkey Pinkey"  Heh heh  Keep it to yourself, remember!!  See you Sunday, maybe, depends when Lynn & I get back from our recording studio weekend... Heh heh... I like saying that... Er... anyway, if you can't be there sunday, still let me know, even though I'm not running the session. Jodi and Al will still take pounds & the register  See you later

      Well...this is what a new fangled computer does then... Interesting...! Having a good half term I hope. I am. Off to do recording on Friday so you'd better say well done the next time you see me - although not at school, eh Ern! Bored you enough now... Paul... how do I get rid of this?................Oh....that's how....

      Can't remember if Lynn said about her having secured a rehearsal pianist for WOO...  Heh heh - still no news on casting ;-)  This is the type of thing I do when I'm bored at work, write messages to people...   Whilst  you  lot are on holiday!! Makes ya sick... Ah well  See you... Going now!!

      An award goes to Eleanor for putting the largest number of comments ever in one go   Heh heh  Great to know people are going finally  And all credit for calling me P Nut goes to Lynn... Bless her  And as for Cromwell's fears about leotards, rest assured we'll try and not put you in a leotard, we want you to be all cuddly and stuff so we're aiming baggy and stuff  Er... Yes...  Keep up with the code words, I've taken note of who's been  Heh heh  See you tomorrow night

      Mmm... Intriguing, Mr Bond...   Re-programming the comments link seems to have retrieved the comments made earlier by those wastrels Ern and Cromwell  Does this mean I can only have one comments thing on my blog? I might have to edit the more pointless comments... Such as "No no no no" or whatever was filling it up earlier, Ernie baby  Right... going to do some work now  traa  
     
    


25,February,2004


     
      I put up a  urlLink Blog  with a link in for people to post comments... Where's that gone then?!  Ah well, here it is again.  If you want to put any comments, messages or anything to me or anyone in HTG, please click on the link below. I'll try and put a new one in every so often so each one doesn't get too full... Cromwell and Ern did fill the missing one up quite a bit... Pesky kids - grrrr   LinktoComments('MANUAL')    urlLink Comment

      Incidentally... Unfortunately, scripts for Wizard D'Oz are only available to hire, not to buy, so we're not able to give you scripts to keep this year...  Scripts are not here yet, so we'll keep you posted on them!!  Congratulations to Shell who was the first person to give me the code word  "Sminky Pinky"  So come on the rest of you, get your acts together  ;-)

      I've announced the cast list, but here it is in black and white... or whatever colours... Make a note of any queries, cause we'll have chats about it Sunday night, we'll run through the plan of action & you can ask us anything then!  DOROTHY - Katie SCARECROW - Ian LION - Michelle TINMAN - Tom WICKED WITCH - Tania WIZARD - Jack (also playing Joe) GOOD WITCH (Glinda) - Georgi AUNT EM - Emily Knight UNCLE HENRY - Stuart E 1ST WITCH - Kat 2ND WITCH - Jade TIBIA - Jeni GLORIA - Claire P LADY GROWLIE - Eleanor MUNCHKIN MAYOR - James B MUNCHKIN FARMER - Hana OZ LADY - Harriet 1ST GENERAL - Beth PRIVATE - Lou OZMAS / SERVANT - Alice "LITTLE WITCH" - Sophie A MUNCHKIN (Referred to in script) - Emma Knight MUNCHKINS / GENERALS / OZ FOLK - Jacqueline; Frances; Charlotte; Hannah; Emily W; Stephanie; Rebecca; Sally; Alexandra; Jacob  There are many single-line parts, the munchkin Barrister, Munchkin Coroner and loads of other parts to dish out, which can only be done as and when we rehearse. Remember that most people will be doing lots of parts, Munchkins, Generals, Emerald City folk. As with Beauty And The Beast last year, those who do not have principal roles will in all probability have more to do than the principals, and I can't stress this enough: THERE ARE NO RUBBISH PARTS in this show, and every single person has to be good, confident, know what they're doing and be with us 100%. WOO is going to be a fantastic show, & it's got last year's show to live up to!!  It's worth saying now, even though it'll be said Sunday, that when we start working on a show, we go through the script and everyone learns what their moves are, where to stand and so on. It can be really dull to sit and watch but it's really important to do that so everyone knows what to do. Remember, the quicker we do it, the quicker things can pick-up and the more we can get done in rehearsals and therefore, you'll have more to do!! If anyone drops out of any of the parts, you may be asked to step in!! So it's really important to watch what's going on & to learn it.   LET'S MAKE A SHOW!!  Sorry, that was corny!!  Anyway, see you Sunday!!

      I am so computer illiterate!  I have tried to get a message onto the comments things but it didn't seem to go. (Btw - have done an exam in computer stuff recently. I passed - no idea how!)  Anyway, if my comment went on then you'll read this twice but if not...  Thanks for all the congrats. Really don't know why we told you but I suppose its cos we are really excited and it's not going to be for ages. Oh and no, you can't all be bridesmaids etc!  Anyway, in the middle of planning work for tomorrow's lessons. Must get back to it.  Lynn  P.S. If you notice spelling mistakes please don't tell me - I know I'm an english teacher but it doesn't mean I can spell!

      Now listen, you lot  In view of the MASSIVE amount of comments put in the comments page bit, I'm wondering how you'd feel about me inviting EVERYONE to join the htg youth blogger. Whereas at the moment you click on the link from the blogger and put comments in, you'd put them directly into the blogger like the ones I put in & it'd be simpler to manage for me, it'd be a better system I think  post your thoughts  All we'd have to do if have email addresses off people & I'd send them an invitation  speak up, gimme ya views

      For those that weren't @ theatre group last night, or those that had gone by the time we told people,  Lynn and I are now ENGAGED!!  Woo-hoo!!  Heh heh  In other news, many thanks to Cromwell and Ern for their work last night  L and I have had too many weeks off now, we'd better do some work ourselves next week!! :p  We've been working outside drama, by the way, so you don't think we're lazy!! I know you lot, and your conclusions!! ;)  Anyway, plenty of hard work next week, well done to everyone for last night & take care, bye, see you, take care, bye, cheers, thanks, bye, take care, thanks, bye

      Paradise... PARADISE!   PARADISE!!    As in the song by Joni Mitchell, cover song from some idiot just recently  They paved paradise to put up a parking lot!!  Come on!!! *sigh*  Ern, cheers for the details re Luke... Got meeting tonight following a rehearsal in which hopefully we'll get the lighting rig plotted, then Saturday morning all being well I'm rigging the front of house lighting bar at the Civic, so if any of my crew were about for that any help gratefully rec'd  Chiz  x

      You'll never guess what they've gone and done!?!?!  They've only gone and paved paradise!!! I just can't believe it, I really can't... There's a new development there, there's signs and everything... Putting up a parking lot apparently  there's just no justice in the world  Heh heh

      Well, sorry for cancelling tonight's theatre group session... As we said to some of you, Lynn & I were back late from rehearsals for Hello Dolly, & we were totally worn out & didn't fancy going and shouting for an evening @ you guys!!   Heh heh  Inceidentally, whilst we're on the subject, Hello Dolly tickets are on sale  Weds March 31st - Saturday April 3rd Note, there are two performances on the Saturday; one at 2.00pm & one at 7.30 pm. We make a point as a theatre group of trying to support each other's work, & so we'd like to see plenty of you there! By the way, some of the older members are running the lighting for this show, so you'd not just be supporting Lynn and me!  And of course there's Ern's play... Sorry, 4got the title :s Tickets available from himself or the Rose Theatre... He'd very much like everyone to come & support him, & would like to say the character he plays in the play is just acting & does in no way resemble his character!!  Ok... Er... Anything else, Lynn??  She says no, so... I guess I trust her  Heh heh  Right, leave me alone then, you lot, I'm going to sit about in the other room

      Oooooooooooookkkkkkkkkkkaaaaaayyyy  The comments link IS working, despite it telling me that this bit of code was not allowed  Interesting... ah well, enjoy still further, kids ;-)
     
    


12,May,2004


     
      Thought I had the comments link thing sorted... I had to insert a line of code between the header tags, you see... It's worked up to a point, in that we can use the old comments links but I can't put in any new ones...  Darn  It'll get sorted, but for now you'll have to use the old link
     
    


12,May,2004


     
      It's not allowing the comments link to go in  Darn  I'll think of something!  My members won't be silenced!!!

      Blogger.com have finally seen sense and allow comments to be made as part of a Blog, as opposed to making us link to a separate site  fantastic  There should be a comments bit at the bottom of posts from now on, so I shall delete the off-site comments thing  From Lonely Paul Cause Lynn's on holiday in Yorkshire without him :-( 
     
    


02,August,2004


     
        I've deleted lots of the old comments links to the pop-up, off-site comments thing we've used for ages... Just to re-iterate, you can now use the comments link built in to the Blog, found at the bottom of each post     GET COMMENTING!!! honestly, give em a holiday, they go all lazy on you *sigh*     Lynn's back from holiday today... "Woo hoo!" as Eleanor would say!     Anyways I'm off now
