      I've been a bit lax but I've been drinking the coffee. Just haven't had time to post. Coffee and donuts today. And a trip to the Eye doctor to get a piece of insulation out of my eye. Not fun.

      These gray days, these rainy days, are perfect for a warm cup. Are these the summer rains yet or are we still in spring.

      Had a great lunch with Krolczyk at India Palace. No coffee involved but some great conversation and even better Indian food. Love those buffets.  When I went back to work I had the obligatory cup o' joe.

      Another one. And some pop tarts cause they taste good. I don't even know why I'm so hungry this morning. Maybe it's one of those gray days things.

      Had a cup a joe with Palmer. Then we played a quick couple of games of guitar freaks. I am so bad at this game. I'll never be a guitarist for sure. Still havn't gotten an A on "Cutie pie" Missed four so I'll have to do better next time.

      Had a good time at John's last night for the "Night of Nights" celebration. Had a night time cup a joe. Good stuff.  Sunday was filled with a number of cups. A cup in the morning pre-church. The Knights of Columbus had breakfast at church which I had coffee, pancake, and bacon. Another cup at home witht he paper. Then some night time coffee witht he Murphy's that night.  The Murphys came by and we grilled tolopia (sp?), asparagus, and had crabcakes. We made banana cream ice cream in our new ice cream maker. We had it on a brownie and served coffee witht he desert.

Good times.  At work now having another mid day cup. A working I go, working on the Pak 36 texture.
