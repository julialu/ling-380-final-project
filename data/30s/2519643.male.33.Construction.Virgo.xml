      Well as most of you know, we are leaving today for a cruise. This is the Boeing 757-200 we will be flying out on and if you look closely, you can see Brandy screaming!!! I got the discounted fair so we will be dropped out of the back of the plane instead of landing. Haven't told Brandy about that yet. HaHa. We will post pictures of our trip when we get back.

      We're back from vacation and we had a lot of fun. We took about 400 pictures from the three islands we visited. The islands we visited were Puerto Rico, St. Thomas/St. John, and St. Maarten. We also spent one night in Miami, Florida. The weather was very humid, extremely hot, and we are glad to be home. I'm sure Brandy will update everyone on more particulars of the trip.

      Hi everyone!  I thought I'd post and let you all know that you can leave messages here for Dave.&nbsp; He's been posting on "Hangar Talk" (link is on the left) giving a journal of what's going on in his training.&nbsp; If you'd like to post messages here just use the e-blogger button down on the left hand side.&nbsp; You can only use it if you've filled out the info. after being invited to the blog.&nbsp; If you haven't been "officially" invited, send an e-mail to Dave and he'll be happy to take care of that for you. Take care, Brandy

      I always look on this Blog to see if anyone has left me a message, but I guess everyone is too shy to post. If you would like to talk drop me a line. I'm sure I can find time from my busy schedule to respond. Other than studying, there is not much to do here in Riverside. Its hot and boring. So I try to check the Blogs as often as I can. Leaving right know for a flight to Santa Barbara and won't be back till 12:30am tomorrow morning.

      Hi Dave!  I don't really know what I'm doing...do you just read this, or does everyone else see it too?!  Thanks for your call last weekend.  We were in San Francisco.  Zachary set a record for experiencing so many different modes of transportation in one day...airplane early in the morning to Sacramento, drive to Vallejo to catch a catamaran into the Bay of San Francisco, cable car down California Street, bus ride to a BART station, then BART all the way to Berkeley for chinese dinner with Great Aunt & Uncle, car ride back to Randy &amp; Jen's in Antelope 2 hours away (fortunately he slept most of it), then a quick night's sleep so we could get back on an airplane again to go home!  It was a whirlwind of a trip, but he had a great time and so did we!  Sorry we couldn't meet you for dinner when you were here.  So glad your schooling has become enjoyable again.  Look forward to seeing you soon.  Love, Dawn
