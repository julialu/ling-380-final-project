       urlLink    All of the previous pictures were made with my brand new  urlLink FujiFilm S5000 . A nice camera with a SLR-Feeling and a great price. It may not be the most technological advanced camera with 10 MP, but it has a 10x real Zoom nice features and costs about 290 Euros, which is great for what it does. I have had the camera since beginning of April and am already kind of obsessed. After about 1200 Photos in 1 and 1/2 month all I can say is  "Wow" .

      Learned something funny yesterday. My wife does not want anything blue or violet in the garden. I found that a bit strange, but she was very firm with that.

      Had a date with a garden-architect. She is supposed to create a layout for our garden. What was really strange was the fact that she just wouldn`t say anything that we could get a grip on. For example if i asked here for prices, she would say something along the line "well you can have a garden for 100.000 $ , but you can get it cheaper or you can have on for 500.000 $..." If we would ask for a suggestion for the garden, she would do the same. It seems that everybody who wants to sell you something, that they themselfs find a bit too expensive they will avoid the price like hot water.

      Everybody seems to think, that the torture scandal is something very new and has only been known since the CBS-Report "60 Minutes", but not only has the Army and the Red Cross know for a long time, but  urlLink there was already a report in smh.com.au  on  June 1, 2003 . Fusilier Gary Bartlam, 18, had some photos developed, when he came home and they included some of the stuff we have recently seen. Quote "One allegedly shows a man stripped to the waist and suspended in the air by a rope attached to one of the forks of a forklift truck. Another is said to show a pair of white legs and the head of an Iraqi male. The hand of a man behind the Iraq's head appears to be forcing him to perform oral sex." "How many other soldiers are like him - who go in naive and find themselves in the same position?"

      After watching the  urlLink keynote  last night, i am not shure what to make of it. On the hardware side, there are  urlLink the new displays , which are nice but not terribly exiting. They look sleek and are in the new anodized aluminum design to fit to the powermacs and they have a bigger (ie 30 inch) display now, which i probably won't be able to afford. On the software side there is  urlLink tiger  ie MacOS X 10.4, which will be available in June 2005 (yes this is one year from now). Most of the new features seem to be a copy from existing tools:     urlLink Safari RSS  is nice, but the features are already covered by  urlLink NetNewswire . Its nice to be able to subscibe to an rss feed with the browser, but thats it.    urlLink Dashboard  seems to be a copy of  urlLink konfabulator .    urlLink Spotlight  is a nice way to 'metaindex' your filesystem and be able to search through it, but that is something that  urlLink Launchbar  does as well, but its good to have it as an integrated part of the OS.    urlLink Automator  is just an interface to applescript by click. That is nice and new and its totally integrated in the OS, which is really cool.    urlLink VoiceOver  is a spoken interface for those with visual and learning disabilities. It is great that apple tries to make the OS barrier free. Not a feature for me..    urlLink iChat AV  looks like fun, but i don't think i have the bandwidth for that.    urlLink .mac sync  ? i can store the settings of my screensaver on the internet now and have to pay for it ? Come on...    urlLink XCode 2.0 ... I am not qualified to comment on that.    all in all i am disapointed with the keynote. Come on Steve, you can do better (ie one more thing). There are some more features, as an  urlLink ichat-server in the tiger server .

The  urlLink blogger help  says this:   Blogs are available on the Internet exactly like other webpages, so they will be automatically indexed by search engines such as  urlLink Google . The  urlLink Listing  setting does not affect this. For more information on getting your site listed, please see Google's  urlLink Information for Webmasters  page.

      How come this site is not yet indexed by  urlLink google ? Don't misunderstand me, i don't think that it has anything to offer, that the world needs to no, i am just curious. It is was  urlLink announced  over a year ago, that  urlLink pyra (the company which developed  urlLink blogger ) was bought by  urlLink google . It has been  urlLink speculated , that they wanted to monitor the update stream.   For Blogger, and for Blogger users (and for the blogging world in general—Blogger-using or not—because I know that's a concern), it's going to mean great things, I believe. We're going to be mapping out more clearly what that means and talking about it soon. We don't mean to be mysterious about that. We just haven't had time to put it all together yet.   urlLink said Evan Williams , co-founder and CEO of (the former) Pyra. I just have to ask, what happend?

      Come on, go into your network center and hug your sysadmin. It may be hard since he is not very socially adapt and he might still look like that geek you used to beat up in high school, but this is the day to appreciate his hidden work. He is the one to make sure everything runs smoothly even though he is forced to keep systems up, that he wouldn't touch in his geeky dreams. Go on, don't hesitate.. it's  urlLink sysadminday .

       urlLink My car , which is only 5 years old, has rust and a broken compressor. Can you believe that a five year old "not very cheap" car needs repairs that amount to 2300 $ ? That isn't even the first repair it got.

      Lots of stuff happening with  urlLink Google  and  urlLink Blogger . Since Google has bought Blogger, everybody speculated what would happen to blogger (assimilate) and look what happened: They gave blogger a sleek new design, they gave us photo-posting, they gave us comments, they gave us a great new editor interface. So far i can only see the good signs. Blogger has been stable as it has newer been before and it is boasting with great new features. And everyone got a  urlLink Gmail Account  too.

       urlLink evhead: Now in Blogger: WYSIWYG  But it doesn't seem to work correctly with my backspace key in Firefox. Might take some time to debug...  Update: To fix the strange backspace  behavior you have to  disable the "find as you type"-feature in Firefox.

      I was quite astonished to see, that entourage now works with digital signatures, just as  urlLink mail has done since panther . I can now encrypt or sign email via the S/MIME security standard. The procedure is nearly the  urlLink same as with Apple Mail . Once the keys are in you keychain, you can select them in the security tab of the account settings. Nice...

      If you are a mac-fan and not able to afford photoshop etc. just go and grab  urlLink Gimp-app . It will fullfil most of your graphic needs. You will need X11, which is on the installation cds from Panther and which i think is installed by default.  urlLink Gimp  is no Apple conform application, but it is very powerfull. Just go and play with it. It is very expandable and has some powerfull scripting in it, so if you are not far from the command line you should be able to create amazing things. And the best news is: Its free!!!.....

      One thing is for sure. THIS SUMMER SUCKS BAD. It's not that i love the sun or the summer, but this year seems to be the worst i have ever seen in germany. We have had rain, rain and again lots of rain. The construction workers at our site (we are building a house) were soaked for most of juli. Our one week vacation on mallorca it rained and right now i am sitting on my balcony and guess what... yes it rains. OT: Went to the movies (what else can you do?) and saw shrek II which was nice...

      Its great to have an anonymous blog. I have had a blog for the last 5 years that everybody and their darling knew about and that made it hard to even post. This is not to say that i wil continue posting frequently, but that it is just more fun to do it without anybody knowing. Had a great night with a good friend and am going to bed now. sleep well....
