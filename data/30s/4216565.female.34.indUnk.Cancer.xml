      Well its that time of year again! Back to school time and what an ordeal it has been! See we moved in the middle of the last school year. I went to the board office and filled out the paperwork and etc. Because it put us in a new home school zone. I told them I would provide the transportation for my kids so they could stay where they were but this year I wanted them to go to the home schools. Well out of my four kids only two were scheduled at the right school! I got everything all settled now but what a hassle this last week has been! You would think that the school system would have it "stuff" together!  On the subject of schools, I really like the way they are calling supplies donations now! Like if you don't buy what they want the school will buy it for them! I am glad however that they have cut down and started providing some things themselves because like I said earlier with four school-aged children it gets quite expensive!  So lets drive safely, and watch out for the kids in our neighborhood!

      So after using Blockbuster online for a week I have seen no real difference between it and Netflix. The only thing I can say is that with Blockbuster you get two free in store video rentals and it is a few dollars cheaper. With both companies I get movies in 1 to 2 days time and ones I return are credited the next day. Is that enough to make me leave Netflix? Not quite yet! :-)

       Just yesterday I found out that Blockbuster started an online dvd club like Netflix. Today I started a two week free trial. The one thing I did notice is that new movies that I could not get yet on Netflix I could get on Blockbuster but I will try it and let you know! Also Blockbuster does not have as big of a collection as Netflix but it is still rather extensive! Just have to see how the mailing is! I will keep you updated!!
