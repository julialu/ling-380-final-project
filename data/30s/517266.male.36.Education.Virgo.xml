      July 26, 2004 - Whoa.  It has been so long since I have last written here.  I have really gotten caught up in the fun of summer.  I will try to write a bit more before the school years gets rolling again.  However, I do want to write about my experience I had over the weekend.    In Noblesville, Indiana, there is a living museum called Conner Prarie Farm.  It is all about life in 1886 when Grover Cleveland was president and the Governor of Indiana was Governor Gray.  I had an opportunity to spend the entire weekend there, living as a charectar of 1886, with my two nieces Anna (a.k.a Christina Hancock) and Angelina (a.k.a. Mary Hancock) along with my sister Katie (a.k.a. Nancy Hancock.)  My name was Salathiel Hartnet.    It was an amazing time.  We worked on the farms, made our meals from scratch, fed the pigs, split wood, and enjoyed evening activities without the benefit of running water or electricity.  It was an experience of a lifetime that I am so happy to have shared with my beautiful angels.  I wish everyone could experience life in 1886.  Priceless.  (And yes, at night if you had to use the 'privy', you instead had to use a 'chamber pot' which is NOT a pot you ever want to eat out of...if you know what I am saying.)  Aloha.
