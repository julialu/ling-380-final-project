The more people watching the slower time seems to flow. If you don't believe it, teach math.   Forty bored faces  Eighty-two eyes watch the clock.  The bell's ring ends class.

      Good evening. Today, our fellow citizens, our way of life, our very freedom came under attack in a series of deliberate and deadly terrorist acts. The victims were in airplanes, or in their offices; secretaries, businessmen and women, military and federal workers; moms and dads, friends and neighbors. Thousands of lives were suddenly ended by evil, despicable acts of terror.   The pictures of airplanes flying into buildings, fires burning, huge structures collapsing, have filled us with disbelief, terrible sadness, and a quiet, unyielding anger. These acts of mass murder were intended to frighten our nation into chaos and retreat. But they have failed; our country is strong.   A great people has been moved to defend a great nation. Terrorist attacks can shake the foundations of our biggest buildings, but they cannot touch the foundation of America. These acts shattered steel, but they cannot dent the steel of American resolve.   America was targeted for attack because we're the brightest beacon for freedom and opportunity in the world. And no one will keep that light from shining.   Today, our nation saw evil, the very worst of human nature. And we responded with the best of America -- with the daring of our rescue workers, with the caring for strangers and neighbors who came to give blood and help in any way they could.   Immediately following the first attack, I implemented our government's emergency response plans. Our military is powerful, and it's prepared. Our emergency teams are working in New York City and Washington, D.C. to help with local rescue efforts.   Our first priority is to get help to those who have been injured, and to take every precaution to protect our citizens at home and around the world from further attacks.   The functions of our government continue without interruption. Federal agencies in Washington which had to be evacuated today are reopening for essential personnel tonight, and will be open for business tomorrow. Our financial institutions remain strong, and the American economy will be open for business, as well.   The search is underway for those who are behind these evil acts. I've directed the full resources of our intelligence and law enforcement communities to find those responsible and to bring them to justice. We will make no distinction between the terrorists who committed these acts and those who harbor them.   I appreciate so very much the members of Congress who have joined me in strongly condemning these attacks. And on behalf of the American people, I thank the many world leaders who have called to offer their condolences and assistance.   America and our friends and allies join with all those who want peace and security in the world, and we stand together to win the war against terrorism. Tonight, I ask for your prayers for all those who grieve, for the children whose worlds have been shattered, for all whose sense of safety and security has been threatened. And I pray they will be comforted by a power greater than any of us, spoken through the ages in Psalm 23: "Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I fear no evil, for You are with me."   This is a day when all Americans from every walk of life unite in our resolve for justice and peace. America has stood down enemies before, and we will do so this time. None of us will ever forget this day. Yet, we go forward to defend freedom and all that is good and just in our world.   Thank you. Good night, and God bless America.--President George W. Bush's Statement made on National Television on 9/11/2001

      A while back I bid $2 on a James Barber cook book (Quick & Simple - TV Companion Recipes) on ebay and won. It arrived today! Since Kim has taken to chicken thighs I thought I'd post a recipe utilizing them here: 
 
 Chicken, Celery & Cider  
 
   4 chicken thighs
   2 sticks celery, sliced diagonally
   1 clove garlic, crushed
   1 onion, chopped coarsely
   1 bay leaf
   1 apple, peeled, cored and sliced
   1 bottle cider
   1 tsp sage
   1/3 cup cream
   Salt & pepper
 
Heat a dry frypan over high heat and place the chicken thighs in, skin down. When browned on each side, add the onions, bay leaf and celery. Stir for a few minutes until coloured and add the apple, salt and pepper. Stir until well coated and pour in the cider. Keep the pan pver a high heat and let the cider bubble. Sprinkle in the sage and cook 5 more minutes. Just before serving, stir in the cream.

      Some minor difficulties with the template. I think I have that all straightened out. It seems there is a problem with either the use of paragraph tags (&lt;P&gt;) or setting Blogger to convert line breaks. A workaround seems to be the use of two breakline tags (&lt;BR&gt; &lt;BR&gt;). *shrug* It seems to work now, nonetheless. BTW, I've been using the &lt;PRE&gt; tag (be sure to close this tag!) to do the ingredient sections of my posts, but one could also do it with &nbsp; (non-breaking space).  

I re-added the Alton Brown links and, also, added links to recipes and info on James Barber, the Urban Peasant.   

I remember watching his show back in the early 90s at my grandmother's house. One time I decided to do some sardine-potato-cake thinggy. My parents were out while I did the cooking. When they returned they were ticked that the whole house smelled like sardines. Ah, but that was a crucial step in my love of cooking.   

At that time I think he was on TLC or something. Now it seems he is on FoodTV Canada. So, too, is Martin Yan (of  Yan Can Cook ).

It came from the  KITCHEN TESTED RECIPES  section of an instruction booklet - well, more like brochure or flyer- for a Rossini hibachi from 1969.

           1   2-ounce bird's nest
    1   quart chicken broth
   1/8  teaspoon sherry
    1   boned chicken breast, finely chopped
    2   teaspoon cornstarch
   1/4  cup of water 
    1   eqq white
   sesame oil (optional)
   peanut oil 

Soak the nest in water overnight. Next day, sprinkle several drops of peanut oil on the nest. Rinse nest with warm, clear water. Feathers should float to surface, making removal easier. Repeat oil-and-wash treatment until bird's nest is clean.  

Place bird's nest and 2 cups chicken broth in large bowl. Add sherry and chicken breat. Steam for 1 hour. Transfer mixture to 3-quart saucepan. Add rest of chicken soup and boil for two minutes. Mix cornstarch with water, then add to broth. Bring to boil, turn off heat. Beat in egg white. Sprinkle with sesame oil. Serve hot.
