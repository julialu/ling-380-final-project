       &nbsp;I think that this pic was taken at my sister's reception.&nbsp; We&nbsp;had a bunch of disposable cameras for the guests to&nbsp;use, and I think that&nbsp;this came from&nbsp;one of those.&nbsp; I&nbsp;swear, every picture of these two is frame-worthy!&nbsp; I just love them!&nbsp; urlLink

       I heard  urlLink    this story     on NPR last week.&nbsp; I think a puppy channel is a great idea,&nbsp; although I don't even have to turn on the TV to get laughable dog antics in my house.&nbsp; I think it would kind of be like the weather channel, though.&nbsp; I turn on the weather channel, not so much for weather info, but I find it eerily soothing.&nbsp; This guy's idea was to have a channel that would make people happy.&nbsp; Puppies, he found, make people happy.
