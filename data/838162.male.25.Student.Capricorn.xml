       The News and Media  Inspired by  urlLink her post on her blog , I have decided to share alittle on this topic. First of all, I'm a total news junky. Usually when I'm on the Web, I'll hit all the major news sites and then some of the more obsure ones as well. Of course I ten to stick to technology news, but I have a wide range of interest (and a quite large sense of curiosity) that I'll read about almost anything news related. I believe being aware of whats going on in the world to be important and it's a great way to start conversations and break the ice.    I have a good friend who is in the Media trade as well, been meaning to get her to start her own blog because she's a great writer (I do hope she is reading this, she knows who she is *winks*). One of the things that I shared with her when she started her studies in journalism is that to always remember that media needs to have   Soul  . What I meant by this, is that every journalist or documentry maker, has a responsibility to the public to give an accurate view of the subject or topic. Not just an accurate view but a complete view as well. I believe that the media should not be telling people what to think or believe, I believe that the media should give a complete story for the people to decide for themselves.  While I can comment the American media on accurately portraying the emotions and horror of the 9/11 incident, I feel that they failed to give proper due to the "other" sides of the story. They may have the soul but they are lacking in depth.  However, other the course of the year, I have seen the media starting to "mature" when it comes to this topic. They have spoken of the devistation of the bombing on the country of Afghanistan and it's people. They have written of the knee-jerk response and treatment of the non-extremist muslims. While it may be too little, too late, at the very least, history will show that the event did indeed shake the whole world as the incident has been labeled, and not just one country, no matter what that country may want to believe. In fact I think that they should take some solemn pride that they have shown that when an attack that is against all that is good and just is done on one of us, it is done to all of us as a Race. We still have that faint unity and with it, hope.  Sleep well

      In light of the increasing tension over in Australia, I would like to sent out well wishes and prayers to my friends over there. I know that stuff like this are usually overhyped and blown out of proportion. But it is also in cases like this that we should remember our friends, family and loved ones overseas and not take for granted their safety, health and happiness. With our ever shrinking world, it is getting even more and more easiler to contact and stay in touch with one other. Let us make that step to keep the lines open. Peace and Out.

       Statu5 Report   “And now you’re back, from outer space…”  Am pretty sure that’s how my blog is feeling after seeing me posting to it again. Heh. Anyway, lets cut to the chase.  Two big unit events just ended for me. It was both long and hard work, but I had off given to make up for the time put in. All in all it was not too bad. Come next week however it’s going to be a new ball game as we all go back to work with lowered manpower (lots of people clearing leave) and under new management. Wish me all the best people, have to make it through this month then I can start to clear my own leave. ORD Loh !! *grins*

       Statu5 Updat3    I have been sleeping on the floor as of late. No, my Mom didn’t throw me out of the house and no, I have no girlfriend that is giving me a hard time. Very simply, my bed broke. Nigel sat on it.  It’s kinda nice being on the floor. It gives a new perspective of my most familiar surroundings. It’s like given the chance to have a fresh view on something we take for granted.  For example, I have a few glow-in-the-dark stars pasted on the ceiling of my room. They are centered around the light it my room so that they would get maximum exposure to the light when it is on. But since my bed is in one corner of my room, I don’t really get to appreciate them. There are not that many of them. But now…my mattress is in the center of the room and when the lights go off, I find myself directly under them.   Lying there, I find that it no longer matters that there are only a few of them. It is enough to shine like beacons out of the darkness, to show that I am not alone in this big murky world, to pour out on me the light that was poured out on them until they fade away, having shared with me all the light that they had.  It makes me wonder about the time I gave a few bags of these stars away. I had brought them back from far away. I wonder if they where used as attended or if they were set aside in a dark drawer, never to see and share the light.  A gift of stars is a wonderful thing. Go out and lie on a grass patch, somewhere away from the city lights and just stare at them. Imagine the stars in the sky as gifts, made millions of years ago, millions of light years away, just for you in that one instant. How long has the Light traveled to reach our eyes. And ponder on the stars themselves, as big or bigger than our Sun, yet burning themselves away to shine for us. Just a fraction of the glory of the One that made them for us.  This holiday season, go out and receive the gift that was given from the beginning of Time and so may it remind you of the Gift that was given to you 2000 years ago, born under the sign of a star.  Happy holidays

       Syncr0ni5e   Just completed my first progress test for one of my Info-Com modules today. The test was conducted on-line and it consisted of 60 MCQ. Not too bad, some were tricky but I completed it way ahead of time. Don’t really know what I was so worried about. I even put off writing on the blog just to study. I guess it’s this studying and working at the same time thing, or perhaps it’s the “so-long-never-study-don’t-know-how-to-anymore” feeling I was getting. No matter, I’m glad its over. I have another test this Sat so I’m not free from the books yet. Not to mention the coming exams. I’ll be so glad when Christmas comes around. All my burdens would have passed away. It may even surpass Christmas 2000 as the best Christmas so far in my life.    This is the final week that I have to report to camp in the mornings. For someone who have gotten used to waking up at 5:30 almost every morning for the last 2 years, 5 months and 1 week, I can’t understand why it’s been so difficult the last few days. I must be totally into the ORD mood. Good in a way, just hope I can last the week.  Was doing some quiet time after lunch today and I started thinking of the Audio and Logistics Ministry that I am a part of in church. I mused on the increased responsibility that awaits me when I join back the ministry in full. As always the lack of manpower is at the foremost of my mind. I am now considering a recruitment drive, most likely after the Youth Camp. Will give this more thought. What you do think?  Been spending a lot of time with my younger brother Nigel as of late. It is amazing how much he as grown in the past year since I returned from my overseas posting. In many ways I am glad that I was able to witness most of it. He has lost loads of his baby fat from daily soccer games, has developed his built with early trips to the gym, push-ups and some light free weights. He even wears the same size shoes as me now. Scary. Now I have to keep watch on his emotional and mental growth. Not an easy task. Since I have to keep a close watch on my own as well. Hmm..

       Statu5 Updat3   I live! :)  I know it sure didn't seem like it over the last week or so but yes (fortunately or unfortunately) I am still alive and determined to continue this online commentry.  It is back to work for me after quite a long break. Only now I work half days for I have taken half day leave for the next two weeks. This is to allow me to study in the afternoons, and looking at how much time I have left I really need to make full use of that time. However I find myself easily distracted, more so than when I was in Poly. Hoping that it just takes awhile for me to get my studying engine back up to speed.  Another important update is that the Home cell group that is meeting at my physical lair (i.e. Home) has begun. It is good to have people around, to sit around and chat in a comfortable setting, to share and study the Bible. Most of the members are younger than me, but nevertheless it is entertaining to listen to them and be there for them if need be. Of course   Edwin   is always the life of the party, with him sharing with us his jokes and stories. He always has this way of getting everyone to unwind and open up. So anyway we meet up on Friday nights at my house. Anyone interested for more details, feel free to drop me aline.  Lastly, here are some plans that I have for the blog coming up this month. I'm planning to get a Links section up on the sidebar, keep a look out for that. And I am still working on that article about the programs and how I use my Palm PDA, for those new palm users who would like some tips, now that they actually own one.  Here I go, back to the grindstone again. Take care and stay sharp.

       Merry Christmas!!   Many blessed wishes to everyone out there  To continue the trend of the last few posts conserning my personality, I thought that this would be interesting. I'm not a big fan of these online personality test, but with the current hype of this long standing series and the strength of the characters in the original book. I figured that this one would be suitable to showcase.  You can find it here:  urlLink Lord of the Rings Personality Test   Here is my result:    You are most like  Frodo Baggins, Son of Drogo  With many acquaitenances, Frodo is deeply attached to a few people, like Bilbo, Aragorn, Gandalf, and Sam. His high ethics come out in his treatment of Gollum and Saruman. Frodo has pity on Gollum and believes that change can occur. You have a strong personal morality. You are committed to relationships and their growth. You tend to be an idealist, believing the best of the world around you. Time alone is important and solitary activities refresh you. You have a tendency to introspection. While providing compassion and being considerate, you may have the tendency of being soft-hearted or even "too emotional" You like keeping your options open. Closure is probably not one of your strong suits.   The Orcs display the evil side of this personality with their lengthy torture methods.  Traits: Empathic, benevolent, looking to the future. On the dark side you could be sadistic.    Happy Holidays once again, may you find cheer and joy in everything and everyone around you. God Bless.

       5nowflakes in the 5ystem    It’s Christmas time in the City.  Many season greetings to one and all. Over the last two days, I’ve witness with some amusement the last minute shopping rush that always takes hold this time of the year. However it seems like this year the rush is even greater and not just in the shopping centers and malls. Online shopping rates jumped again since Thanksgiving. Would look like more and more people are turning to online shopping as a way to beat the rush. I think that the delivery service that these online stores provide is the key selling point. They would even wrap and decorate the gift for you. Very useful if you can’t wrap for nuts.  Kinda makes one wonder why there isn’t any good and established online retailer here? Most likely because the market is small and filled with already established big name brick & mortar retailers. So I guess the best way to go is for these retailers to set up their own website to conduct e-shopping services and to provide delivery.  You will have to forgive me. My new course modules have just begun and one of which is on Electronic Commerce technology, therefore I have been thinking in this areas as of late. It also doesn’t help that I don’t seem to be in the Christmas spirit this year. One would think that I would be jumping around in a red suit since this is the first Christmas where I Don’t have to wear green. But with the things in my life of late, it seems that I’m back to wearing blue.  However the tide is changing. I think I’ve been putting myself low for far too long. If there is any occasion to rise myself up, now is the time. Hmm perhaps it’s not too late to regain that Christmas Spirit and do some Window shopping.  *Grins*     Merry Christmas Eve everyone and all.

        A Heart Made Of Glass   I always had a problem in describing myself. Never could seem to find the words to do so. I’m pretty sure it’s a mindset thing but nevertheless… I then look to words of others like in books or in songs to help describe me. But you know that doesn’t work. They can come close, like in the song in the post below, but never accurate.   I’m going to be open here and present something I found that describes a lot of myself. It speaks of a personality trait that is a major part of who I am. Since this blog is mainly read by people familiar to me, it is a clearer picture of something that you may have noticed but couldn't quite put a finger on. (It explains the “Sng Bui (sour plum)” nickname that some use to refer to me.   Of course since this is the words of the author and still not of my own, it is not totally accurate (I would like to believe that I am not as bad as the character.heh.)   But I look at the character in question and I see a mirror. I can’t say the same for the situations that he faces (especially in Chapter 2) but I believe that I would have reacted the same way.

If you are not mine then why does your heart return my call If you are not mine would I have the strength to stand at all  I never know what the future brings  But I know you are here with me now We’ll make it through  And I hope you are the one I share my life with  I don’t want to run away but I can’t take it, I don’t understand If I’m not made for you then why does my heart tell me that I am? Is there any way that I can stay in your arms?  If I don’t need you then why am I crying on my bed? If I don’t need you then why does your name resound in my head? If you’re not for me then why does this distance maim my life? If you’re not for me then why do I dream of you as my wife?  I don’t know why you’re so far away  But I know that this much is true We’ll make it through  And I hope you are the one I share my life with And I wish that you could be the one I die with And I pray in you’re the one I build my home with I hope I love you all my life  I don’t want to run away but I can’t take it, I don’t understand If I’m not made for you then why does my heart tell me that I am Is there any way that I can stay in your arms?  ‘Cause I miss you, body and soul so strong that it takes my breath away And I breathe you into my heart and pray for the strength to stand today ‘Cause I love you, whether it’s wrong or right And though I can’t be with you tonight And know my heart is by your side  I don’t want to run away but I can’t take it, I don’t understand If I’m not made for you then why does my heart tell me that I am Is there any way that I can stay in your arms?

       Story of a Computer Guy    Well looks like I have finally gotten my system stable enough to return to normal operations. It’s not 100% but should fit my needs as long as I don’t trip over the newly (badly) positioned power cables.  Basically, close to three weeks ago. My system started getting increasingly frequent lockups, strange Operating System errors and Data corruption. I managed to work through most of them, vowing to get to the bottom of it once my exams are over. However 3 days before my papers, the system suffered a series of crashes that resulted in system memory failure and my hard disk partitions totally corrupted. It was quite a large blow to me as my exam revision includes large amounts of online data, but also an emotional blow as I always believed in myself to be able to troubleshoot these types of problems, especially in such an important occasion as it was. Not to mention the finances used in replacing the RAM module. I took this opportunity to submit a upgrade proposal to my sponsors as it was passed in the last meeting that upgrading was needed. However current budget constrains did not permit it at the time. I had to make do with what I had.   I had assumed that the problem was caused by the faulty memory, but after installing it, I found out it was only a part of the problem. Midway through reinstalling my programs and data, the whole system crashed once again.   Something else was wrong.  I spent the rest of that week trying to chase down the problem and finally narrowed it down to a power problem, one of the most overlooked and arcane of computing problems. I replaced my power supply with a newer, more reliable brand and proceed to reinstall.  After 30 hours, the problems resurfaced.  I was at my wits end. It left only two other areas that would be the cause. The power strip that supports my workspace, or the wall socket.     Well to cut a long story short (actually I think it’s a little too late for that) I bought a new power strip and it didn’t really work. It was better but not good enough. In the end I had to stretch the power cables to my other power strip that would result in my cables tripping up people if not careful. I’m praying that this is only for awhile until a more permanent fix is found, such as installing a new wall socket closer to my workspace.  After all this I am back online and it looks like I have a lot of catching up to do. Bare with me everyone, FalchionEdge is back.

       ...Continued   Quite a cool thing today was witnessing  Dex  playing around with his Lomo camera. Thing looks like a toy (but I guess thats partly from Dex's choice of transparent for the color) but it actually a really funky fully functional 4 lens camera. The most interesting about it is the strange color effects that might occur after the picture is taken. I read about it when I was overseas and thought that it would make a cool gift for the arty type of people. Still do. May decide to look into it as gifts for some friends as their birthdays comes along. Thing is not cheap though, but not as expensive as I thought it would be.  Speaking of  Dex , I didn't really want to add on to the emotions that he and  Milton  are already going through. But it would be unjust of me not to mention them before they leave. Both of them have actually been huge influential factors in two areas that I can recall. My interest in playing drums and in having a blog. Sad to say that my interest in playing the drums is for more than my actual talent in it. Lets hope that this blog doesn't go that way as well. Then again, if you want to blame anyone for this blog, now you know who to go after. Good for them that they are leaving heh.  But  Dex  has been a very good friend of mine for a very long time. We basically grew up together in church and while I had a more wayward time before getting involved, we share the same memories of some of the best times we had in church. Recently our paths have diverged somewhat and I'm sorry that I haven't gotten to know better the Awake and now Sonic Edge guys and gals, especially his rocking Pension State Band members. Hopefully after  Dex  leaves, we would still have a common connection. Keep in touch bro. You'll be sure that I will keep bugging you if you don't.   Milton  has always been a big feature in the Crossover youth. He came in with a bang and has been banging away on that drum kit ever since. Apart from missing his quick licks and lighting chops, his huge laughter and corny jokes that rank right up there with the best like Danny and Sean and  Dex , his presence will be missed as well. I'm sure his closest friends are reminding him that they are going to, and will be, missing him when he leaves. I just like to add that they will not be the only ones.  Godspeed my Friends and brothers. I'll see you soon.

       fa5t Updat3   Just a quick one to introduce the two new blog users that I have added to my links. They are both local blogs to sorta make up for the lost of two other local blogs which have now become overseas blogs.heh. All the best over there you guys.  Firstly we have  urlLink Lianne  who I feel writes with a simplicity and honesty that is embodied by the layout and desing of her blog, with a healthy dose of cynicism that gives her words an edge.  Next we have  urlLink skinthrills  and a lovely pink and functional blog. Love all the links and features on the sidebar. Most importantly, she writes with a style that is smooth, causal and lighthearted. Worth checking out  I hope everyone welcomes them and take the time to check out their blogs. It's good to encourage people who have taken the time to share with us their thoughs and feelings and willing to open them up for discussion and new insights.

       Pick of the W33k   What an interesting start to the week. I have been planning to take it easy this week since I just finished a round of test. I still have an assignment due next week but since I have the whole week it’s not a big rush. So now I can turn my attention on the matters that I have left alone during the last two weeks. Apart of which is enjoying myself. To that extend I have spend the last two days catching up on my movie/tv watching list.   Lets see, I started on  Sakura Wars: the TV series  and have already caught up to about halfway through the series. I know it is currently showing on TV but it’s hard to catch every episode everyday. Besides there seems to be a greater understanding of the main theme and plots when the episodes are viewed in close succession. You should try it. Pay close attention on character plots, you can really notice the growth in some of them, which is not apparent with a week long break.  It is not really the case with movies however. They are mostly designed to be self-contained. Even the trilogy type movies, all you need is a basic understanding of the plots from the previous movie to see you through the next one. That being said, one of my greatest times I had was when I sat through an eight plus hour marathon of the  Star Wars  Episodes 4 to 6.  Our movies that I caught up with are  Shanghai Knights  staring Jacky Chan and  The Sweetest Thing  staring Cameron Diaz. ( Cameron Diaz  rocks! She is a big favorite of mine and it kinda scary that she keeps reminding me of someone I know, I think it’s the high cheekbones and mannerisms.)

       turn it up & tune it d0wn   Yesterday (seeing how it's past midnite now) was the first time that the  Crossover Ministry  held it's service in the newly constructed  Youth Hall . Very exciting time it is. We as a Ministry have been praying for a place of our very own for a very long time. Before this we would always be sharing space with other services which would result in some difficulties, such as the sound and worship team only having 15 minutes to set up and soundcheck. Now with our own place, we don't really have to worry so much about such details of where we are and instead can focus more time on what really matters, the people.  However there is still some work that needs to be done. The sound system is not totally complete as of yet. Still missing some cables, floor monitors and effect boxes. Not to mention our own drumset. And the sound team is going to take some time to get used to the acoustics of the new hall. I estimate about a month for us to really settle in. In addition, the sound team now has greater responsibilities, not only for the audio equipment, but now the instruments as well as the whole Hall itself. Frankly I'm looking forward to the challenge.  In any case the very first service there was a blast. There was this new energy and new joy that just spread throughout the people as the musicians played. This is not to say that we only praise Him when we get new stuff, but sometimes it is indeed good to see change in how He provides and cares for us. Of how prayers can be answered, even after many years. The unity of the ministry is growing, not just because we are closer physically while standing in the hall, but because we have been given a greater sense of identity. I can only foresee this unity growing.

       5tatus Updat3   I noticed that I was lacking some important personal information in my profile, so I added some of that in as well as updating the other fields. On top of that I have added some more links to other blogs. This one is long in coming since  Da Man  (no no…not that DA MAN) is so featured on this blog, especially in the tag-board. Of course it’s only justice that I include his better half in my links as well. Happy now D?  I’m also looking to add more links to other bloggers. So my old friends, if you have one that I am not aware of and don’t mind me adding it here, let me know. In the meantime, I’m also looking at other interesting blogs of people that I do not know. Will start off with Singaporean ones first. Will let you know when I do so.

       Taking my own advice   Well...remember what I was saying about doing more emailing? Well this morning I wrote a quick one to another overseas friend that I have not heard from in sometime and guess what? Within two hours the person came online and we chatted over ICQ. Which is rare, as this one is in a stressful and busy enviroment.  I have another friend that I need to catch up with too. If I can get her away from work that is. I had better mention her before she finds out I forgot about her in yesterdays post and takes my head for it  ”There can be only One”  Word to yah D.C.  This email thing seems to be working out so far. Guess I better keep it up. Looks like there is more to email than just for mailing list, newsletters, subject updates, and infrequent questions and greeting cards.  Well...back to work.

       5tatus updat3   Today I managed to get in touch with an old friend of mine. It was really good to hear from her again. Although it was marred by the fact that she didn't call me even though she has been back for almost two weeks and that she forgot about my birthday.  *tsk tsk*  No matter, I forgive her :) I can't say that I've been very active in emailing, so my bad as well. We had a good conversation and I'm glad that we can communicate so well after so long. I've always enjoyed talking to her as she has this certain humor and joy in the way she speaks and we seem to be able to talk about anything. Everyone should have a friend like this. I'm looking forward to meeting up with her soon.   This reminds me of another, even older friend that also just came back, this time from Melbourne. I will have to remember to set a time to meet up with her too, if the boyfriend lets me that is. Especially difficult with V Day coming though.   Seems like Feb is the month to catch up with old friends, especially those returning from overseas. It's a pity that Feb is also the month that I have all my test and assignments due. Better make sure to plan my time well.  In hindsight I guess I should start emailing people more often. Even local friends. Usually my only online form of communication is this Blog and ICQ. But I can't assume that people will read this, especially with my irregular updating schedule. As for ICQ, not everyone would be online at the same time that I will be. With Email, they can't escape. Heh.

       Earth and Bey0nd   It is with a heavy heart that I write this. This past 1 of Feb, the dream of thousands was shattered and put on hold, and for the 7 member crew of the Space Shuttle Columbia, ended.  I always had a fascination with Space. As a young child I would read up on the subject and would stare at the night sky for hours, a habit that I still continue today. In primary school when the Yong Scientist  award scheme was introduced, I tried out for 4 different fields but only managed to get the award for astronomy. It was in this interest that I naturally branched out into reading Science Fiction.  I remember that faithful year. I had just turned 7 and it was to be a sign of a life changing year for me. The space program had been going full force with the shuttle project after a successful run on the Apollo program. Morale was high and a fleet of shuttles was commissioned after the successful testing of the Enterprise. Two shuttles had already been put into active duty with another 2 on the way. It was the second shuttle that I watched on TV that day as it climbed into the sky only to end in a fiery 3 part fireball. The Challenger disaster. It was also a day of firsts, the first teacher was on board and a first step into making space travel more open to the public.  Now the first shuttle has followed it's sister and it took along another first. The first Israeli astronaut. In what what was to be a great symbol for peace and unity, ended in a blaze of fiery flame. It does not bode well for mankind. Nor for the space program. With the hope of a space program to Mars in 2010, there was a hope to take our minds off the troubles on Earth. Of famine, of fear and of war. I had imagined to be able to see mankind living off Earth by the time of my grandchildren, and perhaps have my ashes sent towards the edge of our solar system, in the final eternal journey of discovery.  Now it looks like the space program would be set back another 40 years. And with growing tensions planetside, we may never leave earth orbit again. We may never live among the stars nor be buried in the fields of space, like the heroes before us, who have made it all possible.

That is the profile of the average computer-virus writer, an anti-virus expert said on Tuesday. "They have a chronic lack of girlfriends, are usually socially inadequate and are drawn compulsively to write self-replicating codes. It's a form of digital graffiti to them..."     gosh.

       I'm sure by now everyone is rooted to the media on the conflict in the Gulf.  It has finally began, and therefore I won't go into my reasons for why they should or should not do, I have been putting off writing them as a matter of fact. And frankly it doesn’t matter anymore now.  What matters is to pray for the fastest and best resolution to this situation. May God watch over those who are involved, on both sides and  especially  the ones caught in the middle.   May God forgive us all.

Trying to do something about that, but so far no go.... it's a pity...I consider the archives to be an important part of a blog. Not only for others to catch up with whats going on, but also for oneself, to go back to read what I once wrote and reflect on how far (or how low) I have gone since then.  In the meantime enjoy the faster loading, and I hope to have some pics/graphics up soon because...well frankly...because I can *grins*

       *stretches*  Well, that's it. Another round of exams over. Not totally happy about though, but I don't think that I'll fail. Yeah... think ...  Wandered around the City Hall area after my paper, went to check a few things out, windows shop for a bit...pretty boring...  Was kinda looking for something fun to do...I mean it's just after exams so it's only natural, but on top of that I only have a small window of time for R&R before I jump back into the fray with that project due early May. Kind of worried about it. I barely have two weeks to do it and yet it counts for like 90% of my marks for that module. Worse of all I have no idea how to start it. Looks like I have to contact my lecture and throw him some questions.

       *sigh*  Another 10 day gap between posts. I got to go back to writing more often.It's been quite a busy week studying for my on coming exams in less than 2 weeks time. I could have gotten a better head start on it if it weren't for the fact that I was busy studying another module which I though would be having it's exam around the same time, only to find out that it's a non-exam module.  grrrr . Wish they had told me earlier. Yes I know how it can seem unusual, but I assumed that all modules had exams and wasn't told otherwise at the beginning on this one. Yea Whatever.

      Allow me to speak about the news, since there is so much of it now and so many people looking for it. However lets not speak what's  on  the News, but  the  news itself and how it effects (my own) lifestyle. Back in my poly days I was a big news junkie. Part of my daily routine would include spending an hour half to 2 hours just hitting all the news sites on the Internet, followed by another 45 minutes of reading the E-mails I would get from the newsgroups that I had subscribed to. Even my girlfriend then, towards the end of that time, was going to (and now is) study journalism. When I enlisted, part of the problem early on was similar to a "News cold turkey" which came from being cut off from the outside world (and the above mentioned girlfriend of course). Would "waste" away my precious weekends just trying to catch up on the week. And it only got worse when I was posted overseas.  The other subject I like to touch on seems off tangent, but I will link it all back later, is radio. My interest in radio has waned much since the growth of digital music and the trend of personal music that arose from it, which I am a firm supporter of.   However since the module that I'm learning now focuses on media and broadcasting, I've started to regain more respect for radio in the fact that it's actually the most up to date media in the area of News. It's a wonder why I never thought about it before and even if I did, why didn't I implement it? Like my module states, radio is still around because it's so pervasive, it can be found anywhere and is cheap.  So perhaps I should look into getting a small hi-fi or standing radio and keep it on the news radio channel whenever I'm at my desk, that should allow me to ease off the need to "waste" time getting

      Finally I am an owner of my own personal digital camera. Now I can join the league of arty photo-takers who post seemingly abstract shots on their blogs like  urlLink tess  and  urlLink jon   *grins*  . All I have to do is to find someplace to host the photos and link them to here.  Another league I believe I can officially be a part is the gadget freaks. I mean take a glance at the list: mobile phone, MP3 player, Sony PDA and digital camera...I'm practically a Harvey Norman. And one would think my level of "geek" couldn't get any higher. Guess I just "leveled" up ( *heh*  another geek reference).  Well, we can look at it in two ways. On one hand, it fits in with my future line of work in IT. I would need to be familiar with the product in order to properly advice and troubleshoot for people, and what best way to get to learn about than to actually own and use it?   And the other end is that, perhaps I will take it up as a real hobby and more time will be spent outdoors and away from my desk and computer. Goes well with my new bicycle that I just got now that I'm starting to learn how to cycle finally after all these years.  Whichever the outcome,  it's all good .

      What a week it has been. Quite a fruitful school-break if you ask me. Managed to spend time with some of the guys, seeing as how their school terms have ended and they too are pretty much free at the moment. Of course all this going out and eating out is a drain on resources that I am trying to conserve. But seeing as how I'm only free, more or less, this week, I guess it's ok to indulge. Next week onwards I can let my bank, as well as my friend's pockets, take a break.

      *sigh* After reading  urlLink  DebbieC   blog I really feel bad about not posting in so long. Really do deserve to be beaten about on the head for it. I mean I know I tell myself I only write when I have something really to write, but looking at my last few posts, well there is nothing really outstanding about them. They are not long essays on the decay of our world's moral fibre or things along those lines. They are simple observations at that point in time from a guy who just simply wants to share it with people. It is something that can be done at almost any point in time. So why can't I?  I guess everyone who has a blog has one point or another wonder about why we bother to try to update it. For me it's a little different. I know why I want to. But I wonder at why I don't do so. Is it some commitment thing? Not surprising coming from a guy, but I never thought I would have a problem in this area since one of my goals in life is to be comitted, for life, to someone. So why can't I be committed to such a simple thing as putting a few lines up here? If I can't even commit to this, how can I reach my goal?  It's not the first time I have started something and lost steam along the way. My first web site was abandoned after a month and left to rot for almost 6 years. I didn't even take it down until I moved the blog to this server. I have tons of unfinished stories and ideas for stories, incomplete designs...all flashes in the pan. I can't even complete a computer game from start to end anymore and books I blaze through in the fastest time possible, ignoring other stuff, only to set the book aside and never touch it again when I'm done.   Things need to change. And I'm glad I can see it.  But the focus shouldn't be just on me. Everyone who is committed to something should wonder..."why am I doing this? Is this what I really want? Or am I doing so out of obligation or resignation? If It is out of duty, then do I still believe in it?"  Knowing what we want is hard enough, reaching it is even harder still, but even if we take the first steps towards it, may we see it to the end, not only to the end of the goal, but to the end of our best that we put in it.

      Written on date 20030614:   I'm writing this as I sit in the cafe of my hotel here in Bangkok, awaiting breakfast on the second day of the trip. One of the things I enjoy the most while on these kinds of trips is the intercontinental breakfasts. I guess I have a soft spot for having orange juice with bacon and eggs in the mornings, something I don't do while at home. After this, we will be taking the "skytrain" to some other popular shopping complexes since we have already spend quite some time with the one next to our hotel.

      Well I just finished packing for my trip to Bangkok tomorrow morning. It’s just a short trip and I will be back on Sun(15/6).   Somewhat looking forward to it. It’s been awhile since I have been on a holiday out of town. Then again this should be concerned a working holiday since I will be helping to haul large loads of clothes for my mom’s home business. She mainly deals with female apparel but she’s looking into picking up some men’s stuff this time around. Anyone interested? Drop me a line. Maybe I can talk her into giving discounts :)  Another thing that has me excited is that this would be a great opportunity for me to make full use of my “new” digital camera. In fact, I remember making sure that I will get the camera especially for this trip. Will be sure to post some of the better shots when I get back. Really looking forward to getting some fancy and art shots over there. Will have to keep my eyes open.  Hoping to have a good time shopping. Clothes, games, little nick-nacks, anything goes. Of course I must remember to get some stuff for my friends as well. I know both  FeLee  and  LadyRaine  have made their requests quite well known.  *grins*  don’t worry guys, I won’t forget.  So until then…Have a good week and God Bless.

      At least, not yet.  Even as I write this, I am still hacking away at the pile of work that I have had for this month, which consist of 3 projects plus 3 reports. All of which are not yet completely done. And they are all due within the next two weeks. I just seem to keep getting stuck whenever I focus on one, thus I have to keep jumping from topic to topic. The problem lies in that all three projects are based on some form of programming and to even start to code requires some time to learn the different languages and their quirks. Needless to say, it’s this learning curve as well as troubleshooting that have really taken up a lot of my time.   I’m afraid that I may not meet the deadline for the last project and I’m not sure what kind of extension, if any, I will get and what kind of grade penalty I’ll receive because of it.  *Sigh*  In any case, it’s all my own fault really. I think I spend too much time running into brick walls when it comes to my projects then stepping back and thinking about how to find another way around them and not feel frustrated. It’s strange. I am usually not the kind to be so incapacitated by my emotions. I’m usually in far better control over them. And yet I wonder where all the time as went. In the last 25 days I’ve only been out of the house 9 times. It’s insane. I put aside everything, all my other outside commitments and yet I still can’t do 3 simple projects.  *sigh*  this doesn’t bode well. If such a small workload is killing me, how am I going to handle real working conditions?    This is turning into a nightmare, and it may only get worse. If I do fail the module for the 3rd project because I miss the deadline, I don’t know what is to become of my course schedule, will they let me continue into next year course? or will they require me to wait until I retake the module, which is the problem since I believe the next time this module is conducted again is in next April.   Guess I just have to buckle down, ride the storm and put my nose to the grindstone. And after it’s over, I’ll have to take a nice long look at how I handle my emotions, my time and my responsibility to my work.

      A little late with the update this week, so lets jump right into it.   Going through the news while listening to the  urlLink Black Eyed Peas  makes for an interesting read. Basically I have no longer the need to make one-off comments like I usually do. The soundtrack speaks for itself.  As we go headlong towards the anniversary of that faithful day that started it all and the faithful days that have followed it, it is easy to lose sight of common goals that we as a species I feel we should strive towards. As I look at the  urlLink night sky  this week, I ask myself how much better it would be if all the resources, human and otherwise, time and energy that we have been using recently to respond to as well as create, the various situations that we now are in, was directed towards that one goal. Or any other common goal for that matter. As long as it takes us away from ourselves and gives us something to work towards together. Yes indeed, how much better it would be.

Still looking into new hosting options and other blogging tools. Should I consider Blogger Pro? Or go for the web host and use Movable type? Also came across a new blog host/tool site TypePad. It looks very interesting, especially the photolog services.

        Time:2:39am Mood: Much calmer and generally better than I have been in the last two weeks.    Been slowly moving back into attending to the things that I have been neglecting as of late and it's really quite therapeutic. It’s good to be able to kick back, address issues one at a time, and focus my attention. Guess I don't work well under pressure after all. Thought I would have that figured out by now.  And thus I now, once again, find myself at this time of the day, sitting in the dark bathed in only the illumination of my computer monitor. Except this time I'm kicking back writing this, a beer in one hand and changing CD-R's in and out of my computer while it is backing up all it's hard drives. Ahh...the Zen of living the digital life, who said beer and electronics don't mix? Just don't actually add the two together unless you want to find yourself in  Electric Dreams  .  But after so long, I still find myself suffering from that age-old holiday syndrome, where I still have to find for myself things to do or be bored out of my wits. One thing that I should do is catch up on my reading. I have these thick books to finish that are just lying around the place. Some of them are textbooks, so that’s most likely the reason why I’m so reluctant to get into them. Oh well, I will have to anyway, before things get busy again. Perhaps after I get done doing some packing that I also have been putting off, like equipment and clothing colored green…   *Yawn*  well the backup is going to finish soon, so I guess I’ll pack up here, get a nap and post this later in the morning.

      Finally I'm able to let go of that which have been bordering me the whole of last month. However all is not well, for the outcome of the project is very much in question, not the kind of situation that one would like to be in at the start of one's holidays.   There are many reasons why I now find myself in this predictement, "I didn't have the proper background", "I had to learn it from scratch", "I had two other projects to handle". But, as it is for most of life's lessons, I am not without blame for putting myself in this spot. so, as it is for life's lessons once again, I will have to pick myself up again, and carry on.   Which of these is the good part or the bad part, I am unsure.   One thing is for sure though, as I approach the first anniversary of this blog, it looks like my plans to move to a new web host would have to be put on hold. Life lessons are rarely without a price, so finances are going to be tight for the next few months.  Something tells me that I should just focus on posting regulary.

      Over the weekend, I had the fortunate experience of attending a virtual “Meet the author” book club meeting held in  urlLink Second Life .  urlLink Cory Doctorow , the author of “ urlLink Down & Out in the Magic Kingdom ”, was gracious enough to come in-world (although he doesn’t “play” Second Life) to give an interview and to field questions based on the ideas and topics raised and touch on in his novel.   I managed to read though the novel a day before the book club and I find it to be very much to my liking. It falls firmly in what I consider to be  CyberPunk , in which instead of technology being the basis of bigger and faster action like in  Star Wars  and  Star Trek , it uses technology to bring to light the essence, strength and overwhelming frailty of Human nature. I have nothing against both  Star Wars  or  Star Trek , but sometimes I just need a good dose of a more gritty type of science-fiction.  And what a concept the book paints, a world were reputation is currency, where death is defeated by “back-up” booths and forced-grown clones, where computers are implanted and all set against the backdrop of  Disneyland . Yet with all the technology, humans are still subjected to the roller coaster ride (if you pardon the pun) of emotions such as failure, disappointment, betrayal and boredom.  In the end the book comes highly recommended. If you like you can download a full copy of the novel from  urlLink here .  All in all one of the best events I have attended in  urlLink Second Life  in some time. Looking forward to the next one.

      Right, on to the rest of the week (last week). A few days after the day spent with  Nigel , I met up with  MchWng , an old friend who incidentally is only free on school holidays even though she is working. And that’s when she’s not rehearsing for a new play. We don’t meet very often, sometimes once every 4 or 5 months.  I have to say that I was quite presently surprised when I saw her. First of all it was actually daytime and I didn’t know how “new” it made things seem.. usually we only meet for dinner and we were actually debating when was the last time we had met up and seen the sun.  Next, she was dressed more…casual than I’m used to seeing her in since she didn’t come down from school. It was a nice change.  We sat down for some waffles, chatted and later went for a walk down past the riverside. Apart from a call from  FeFe  asking questions as he was sitting opposite us during the waffles that threw me off, I had quite a nice time just hanging out. Truth to be told, its been a long time since I had an outing of this sort. However I do find myself somewhat more uneasy being around  MchWng  than before. I guess, it’s because we’ve known each other for almost 5 years and she has seen me in my bad times and my even worse times. She’s sorta like by  Aunt Agony . But I told myself sometime back that I shouldn’t just treat her as just that. As I have always taken issue with others taking my friendship and me for granted, I shouldn’t do the same to her. And since how that both our situations have changed recently, it’s like starting anew again. I guess that’s not so bad, but only if I get myself out of this funk and start treating her like everybody else and not as my  psychiatrist . I mean I don’t treat  FeFe  as my lawyer or  DaMan  as my doctor.   Perhaps we should break the 3-4 months per meeting routine…

      I had a pretty interesting “holiday” week this past week. Actually it’s  Nigel  who is the one on holiday since I technically don’t get any unless you count those self-declared couple of days I try to squeeze in between modules when they are not overlapping.  Anyway, I was starting out the week pretty much the usual, studying and reading mostly, when  Nigel  gets the wild idea for us to find a network game to play to past the(his) time. He had just burned himself out on  Unreal Tournament 2003  (again) and therefore had the idea to give  Rise of Nations  another go seeing as how it is about the only Real-Time Strategy game that we both can actually stand to play ( Warcraft 3  so being NOT the one). So we sat on down and proceed to get our a$$e$ served to us in what turned out to be a 5 course meal.  Next day we decided to recover from our defeat by spending a nice quiet afternoon fishing, which turned out quiet nice actually. It had been a long time since I can just take in the sounds and the breeze of the sea. I had forgotten how much I had loved being on the top deck of the cruise ship I was on almost 5 years ago. Truly made for some conducive studying.  Pity  Nigel  had the misfortune of losing his fishing weight and hook…again. He would like to claim that he lost it in an epic battle of wills and determination between teen and fish, alas it was a simple really ugly miscast that snapped the line. Perhaps lighter weighs are in order…  In kindness and, well…pity, I took him to  Australian Outback  restaurant for some aussie style food. Of course before I go any further, I must submit a declaration that “I do know it is hardly comparable to Real aussie food but it’s the closest I can find over here” before my friends who are Down Under declare me a heretic and nuke my mailbox. Hey guys? If you want me to sample the real good food you guys get sent me the ticket and I’m there ok? ;)  In any case I was craving for a huge steak dinner and  Nigel  as been bugging me about the beaded mushrooms that I keep telling him about. So we sat down to two 28 ounces sirloin steaks, one grilled to a medium rare and the other well done. Followed by a bowl of hot breaded mushrooms with spicy ranch sauce. It’s so rare to have a nice civilized meal with my younger sibling without the toilet jokes and insults. I guess the endless refills for our huge drink mugs helped keep him pacified. I do wish we had spoke on more serious stuff than just in-line hockey and school but I guess we can save that for the next time.      I also had an interesting outing with someone else on “holiday” during the week. Will talk about it soon once I get my head to it.

      I was talking to my friend  CC  from  urlLink Second Life  and she mentioned something that stuck me. Not so much so that it was surprising or unexpected, but in that it forces me to realize somethings that I may not want to.  She told me that from the first time that we had met, she had felt a sense of sadness from me and that she continues to feel it each time we talk and she was wondering about it.  Now I will not be so bold as to deny or agree with her straight off, but what really bordered me was that she was able to gather this sense through an electronic medium, from the other side of the planet, with nothing to go on but the words that I type, and to a lesser degree, the actions that I do in the Second Life world. You have to understand that no matter how realistic  urlLink Second Life  tries to be at times, the 3D avatars that are your stand ins when in-world do not perform any body language or show any emotion unless you want it to. And I’m sure I didn’t.   This lends to the second thing that disturbs me. If something whom I never even met face-to-face can detect it, what does it say about the friends that I have and do meet on a regular basis? Has this sadness become such a part of me that they can’t tell any difference anymore? Or they do know it but feel that they we are not close enough to me to talk to me about it, is my relationship with my friends that shallow? Either reason is something I would want to consider.  And lastly, it brings me back to the question Am I really sad? I will be the first to admit that I’m not completely happy with my current state in life, but then again, who is? Life needs a degree of bad times for us to appreciate the good times. True I may have been in instances where I have been badly hurt, but those times are neither uncommon nor recent. And I have been believing that I have been moving away from those times and carrying on with my life. Or is in the process of doing so. Read back the archives that show some part of the road that I had to take. But now this forces me to ask if I am really doing so. Am I still stuck in that rut? If so, have I once again wasted years of my life wallowing in something that I cannot change and even if I did, would the outcome be any better or different? If it is true then where is my faith? In things that would be better and good for me?   And to top it all off, I just had bought a new CD and I just took a look at the lyrics for a one of the tracks that caught my attention.      I'm so tired of being here Suppressed by all my childish fears And if you have to leave I wish that you would just leave 'Cause your presence still lingers here And it won't leave me alone  These wounds won't seem to heal This pain is just too real There's just too much that time cannot erase  When you cried I'd wipe away all of your tears When you'd scream I'd fight away all of your fears I held your hand through all of these years But you still have  All of me  You used to captivate me By your resonating life Now I'm bound by the life you left behind Your face it haunts My once pleasant dreams Your voice it chased away All the sanity in me  These wounds won't seem to heal This pain is just too real There's just too much that time cannot erase  When you cried I'd wipe away all of your tears When you'd scream I'd fight away all of your fears I held your hand through all of these years But you still have  All of me  I've tried so hard to tell myself that you're gone But though you're still with me I've been alone all along  When you cried I'd wipe away all of your tears When you'd scream I'd fight away all of your fears I held your hand through all of these years But you still have  All of me  (My Immortal by Evanescence)

      I have been scouring the Net for this book,  urlLink Plowing the Dark  by  urlLink Richard Powers . I heard that it is similar to  urlLink Snow Crash  by  urlLink Neal Stephenson  in that it talks about a virtual Cyberworld where people worldwide log-on to and interact with others and their environment in real-time.   I’m a big fan of Stephenson and of his peers,  urlLink William Gibson  and  urlLink Bruce Sterling . If you haven’t realized this yet, then you haven’t been looking around this website enough  *grins* . I remember reading most of their old stuff but never actually owned them until recently, (I think I dug them out of some corner in my primary school library or something like that) and would like to read Power’s take on this genre. Well it looks like I will have to access a library for a hardcopy of the book after all as I have not been able to find an e-book version.  Talking about the “Metaverse” or the on-line virtual world that is the basis of both of the books mentioned above, one should look into  urlLink Second Life . It is the closest form of a “real” virtual cyberworld I have seen yet. In fact, I have been participating in the beta test ever since I heard about it in April. In short, all I can say is that it is a very intriguing concept that uses state of the art technology. Being able to chat and interact with people all over the world in real-time and a realistic looking environment really brings to life all the ideas that one can imagine in being a virtual world where almost anything is possible. Events are constantly being held in-world, users buy land and build houses and shops, sometimes in a group as building in-world is done in real-time with everyone seeing the results at the same time. Users take a lot of effort to make their in-game avatars looking surreally like how they are in the real-world and even upload images to be made into clothing. Any fans of ICQ/IRC chat programs and enjoy messing with 3D design programs will totally feel at home there. If you do decide to take a look, remember to let them know that  urlLink I sent you .             urlLink

      Late update once again. I’ll really trying to keep to posting at least once a week and within 10 days at the most.   I really love the latest run of local newspaper columnists recently. Yet another thought-provoking article in the Life! Section last Tuesday. Speaks on a topic close to my heart. I know it is once again about relationships and talking about that can get old very fast. Heck even I’m sick of talking about it, but beats all the computer stuff that no one else cares to read or understand here right?  The said article talks about the Columnist’s experience and reason for wanting to remain friends with her ex boyfriend and she talks about why would she want to, why it’s something that more people should do and the obstacles she had to overcome. Now I would love to reprint the whole article here, but since I don’t have permission, I shall have to resort to just highlighting certain points that she made that I agree with and summarize it.  The writer notes that it is not easy going and requires “maturity, patience and several misfires”. She recalls that it was difficult when her ex had to run off on a date during an outing with mutual friends, how a hug or a pat on the shoulder can bring back painful memories but they “peter out over time”. But even with all this she carries on, in part due to the idea that past relationships help make one become stronger as a person and as an individual. Over advantages she notes includes being able to quiz him about what she did wrong so that she won’t make the same mistakes next time and how he can be used as a “pseudo Gay Boyfriend” in which with all the sexual tension over with, they can just “hang out without feeling self-conscious”. Lastly she muses over how her ex and she now swap testimonials on  urlLink Friendster.com  and that he remembers her birthday and sends flowers. She feels that they are more “saner” as friends and that everyone deserves a second chance.  I’m quite glad to see good writers on the payroll of my local newspaper. It’s good to see them being able to stretch their talents and speak on personal experiences as well. I’ve always had firm respect for journalist and this just reinforces it. Of course not everyone can be a Dave Barry, who is more humor based then anything, so it’s good to have a good balance of insight as well as whim.

      Well I had an interesting chat on the phone last night. It was very good to hear her voice again. And, truth to be told, good that she was the one that called for I had resigned myself to the possibility that things were only going one-way down a two-way street for some time now.  It was a good chat. A lengthy one. And while she may have felt that she dominated most of the conversation, I didn’t notice, nor would I mind.  It went quite smoothly except for one awkward occasion. My fault really…it came from one of the few things that…well…I still don’t understand. But I must remember that  understanding  is not a prerequisite for  acceptance . Such is the way of most things in life. Of what is called   Faith  . We may not fully understand how electricity works, or how gravity works or even how God works. But all these are accepted. They are facts. Likewise when dealing with people. Especially when their actions, directly effected or used to effect, you.  It all takes time really. Just like so many things once again. I believe I may be limited in my thinking, that I’m not getting the big picture, that there is a piece of the puzzle missing in my mind. I don’t intend to dig up past issues, I’ve gone way past that, and may well be my biggest problem previously. No, I think I’m missing a current issue, and it’s my hope that when I do bare witness to it, everything will fall in place.  So are you seeing the big picture in the things and people around you? Or are you so caught up on your own limited view of issues?

      It’s interesting to note how I seem to find the most profound articles in the newspaper nowadays. I have to say the column writers are an interesting bunch, when they are not trying too hard to be funny of course. But the ones in my local paper have been coming up with some thought provoking stuff recently.  Just last week there was a female columnist who was remarking about how most of her family and friends still consider her to be unwed even though she has been legally married for close to 4 years. Just because she didn’t hold a church wedding or a wedding dinner to go along with the signing of the papers. She was talking about how the Chinese wedding dinners especially, have become such as sideshow serving no other purpose other than to show off and to pacify external family members with free food.   I may not totally agree with all her points, I for one feel that a church wedding service is the bare minimum, but I do think she is on to something. Young couples nowadays have so many expenses to deal with, let alone to throw a dinner party that can go into the tens of thousands. Especially in the slow economy that we are all facing these days. I think that a series of small, intimate dinners with groups of people who actually know each other would be enough.  And today, another columnist wrote something that touched me as well. It seems like fairy tale-like lover stories do happen in real life: boy and girl meet, love at first sight, they go out, they have problems, they break up, apart they realize that they do need each other, they work out their own individual problems, they get back together, they get engaged.   On reading it, it started out as a reminder on how my own “fairy-tale” didn’t have a happy ending. But on the other hand, I’m really happy for the writer and his partner. To have worked things out and come out of it stronger gives much hope to others who are having problems or are afraid.  However the one thing that stuck me the most, was something that I too have said to others before. He wrote that the best way to find that someone is firstly to be happy being single, to be happy being alone. For if one tries too hard to search, one’s vision is easily clouded by one’s desire. But if you are truly happy being by yourself, you would be able to clearly see the good and bad points of the person and take them at their true value.  To have this written in a newspaper is sort of like saying that yes, there is still hope. Just hang in there and learn to be happy.

      *Whew* Just finished handing up the report for my module on Broadband Commuications. Thats the reason for the lack of updates this past week and a half. You know...I really got to give some fair warning before I dissapear like that. Otherwise the people who do read this (mainly digital crickets I think, but hey...you never know) would think I'm just irresponsible and lazy. And I wouldn't want that now do I?  On a related note. I got back the results for my three project modules. The big surprise is not the good grades that I got for the first two, but the fact that I didn't fail the last one as I had expected. Frankly speaking I would have failed myself if I was doing the grading, but failling that module might have derailed my entry into the final year of my degree for as much as 9 months. Now that I have scrapped through on a passing grade, there should be no delay.  I am totally grateful for this unexpected blessing...best of all its just all the more reason to celebrate!

      Now Usually I’m one who takes some time to get into the Holiday Spirit. Which is strange, for this time is usually the busiest, what with Church events to help out in, cards to write, shopping to do and Christmas dinners to eat. But over the years, I find that I only start feeling it at the last minute. Therefore there is always a rush to write cards and gift shop and then…it’s all over too soon.  I guess part of the reason why I’m so Scrooge ( Bah! Humbug!)  about holidays at times, is that I somehow always found it lacking in some way. Must be the romantic in me that has this set vision of how Christmas should be and of course it never turns out like that. One year in particular was nearly perfect, but only served to raise the standard, so to speak, that only make the following years feel even less pristine.  But now we come to this year, and somehow the old holiday spirit is kicking in extra early. And so I sit here and ponder why. Maybe it’s the really cold weather that we seem to be getting over here this year. Been doing a lot of sitting in front of my window studying as of late, with the chilly breeze a constant companion. So much so that it drives me to distraction with illusions of Winter and of such. Another reason could be because a friend was sharing their enthusiasm for the holiday, complete with tree decorating ideas and gift buying plans. Or it could be that I’m so sick of having exams cut so deep into the holidays that my mind would wander across rivers just to find something to occupy itself with rather than the topic at hand.  But like the plot for any tragic character, it so happens that this is the rare time where I actually  want  the spirit to kick it late. Mainly because I want to focus on said exams and furthermore, I’m flat out broke. So all these ideas and holiday urges… I can’t act on them!   Frustrating I tell you.  Here’s hoping your festive plans are doing better. Season Greetings.

      It has been once  hell  of a week. And I mean it that way. Really, one hell of a week. Worse one I had in more than a year, even worse than that time I was rushing that Visual C++ programming project. The problem lies with some details about my degree course final year that I would be starting next year. It’s all my fault really, and I’m not pleased with myself for making such a big mistake. I already don’t think very highly of myself, no need to actually go out there and make it come true! In any case, I’m hoping very hard that this issue can be resolved soon.  On top of that, I have to go and  lose  my waist pouch with both my handphone and Sony Clie in it. Made a police report and everything, but I guess whoever found it, was not nice enough to return them. Can’t say I blame him, it takes the best of us of turn down a free handphone and PDA. But nevertheless, it is the right thing to do. Guess not everyone can place himself or herself in the position of the other person who has lost it. In any case, to whoever it was who “ found ” my stuff, if you’re somehow reading this: enjoy your windfall, cause you’ll get what’s coming to you, someday. Oh and I hope you found a way to charge the Clie, the sucker drinks batt power fast.  Thankfully, my parental unit (i.e. Mom) still has her old Motorola V60 lying around, so I’m using that for the time being. Unfortunately it’s going to take some time to get used to the different interface. Some of the Motorola interface is quite troublesome, or perhaps I’m just too spoilt on Nokia.  So with the need for a new phone pushed down the priority list, the next in line would be the PDA. So digging into my savings, I sprang for the new  urlLink Tungsten E  from  urlLink palmOne . It’s the most value for money handheld that they have and after using it for a few days, I’m very pleased with it. Just wished I had gotten it under better circumstances. Now with my savings drained, looks like I’ll have to wait longer for that  urlLink Creative Nomad . Or anything else for that matter. Hope my old player can hold out that long.   So a gentle reminder to myself is in order, always check your stuff, don’t be careless and don’t take what you have for granted.

      Finally got around to putting up some additional pages for the blog. It's quite a big step. After one year, this is no longer just a one page blog. It's now a full website with blogging features of course.  In anycase, I put up the  urlLink Writings  section with one story for a start. I'm looking it fill it up with some stuff over the next few weeks. Hopefully it would look filled out before the start of next year where things really get busy for me over here.  In any case, if anyone got feedback on the stories, feel free to drop me a line.

      Just a quick note. Have two tests staring me down this week which are delaying me from putting up the new pages to the site for my writing section and so forth. Will get them up as soon as I'm free from study.  Been spending time with   Da Man   and   Nigel   over the last week. One is out of leave, which is always a momentous event with his work schedule, and the other is out on school holiday. Being a good friend and brother, I felt it was only right that I make some time out from studying to spend time with them. In fact, I was with them on the first show for the Matrix Revolutions on opening day.  Speaking of Matrix Revolution, I will need to post up my views and full review of it and the Trilogy as a whole. The critics and peer reviews have been really bad and scalding. While I do think it is a little disappointing, nevertheless it is a must see at the very least as a form of closure and a fitting end to first movie.

      Feeling kinda chipper today, which of course is unusual knowing me. Factor in that I have been playing  urlLink Max Payne 1 & 2 , in which good things like falling in love is made bad and the bad things made, well...worse, it’s a wonder why I’m so hyped up.  One of the major reasons is, of course, that  urlLink Matrix Revolutions  opens in less than  urlLink 22 hours  and counting. Finally the best movie trilogy to come around since  urlLink Star Wars  comes to an end. And I’m pretty sure that The Matrix will have the same impact on future methods of storytelling and on pop culture that it had.  Other factors include, the shiny new floor of my room. No more decayed looking carpet and thus much more travel when rolling from end to end in my chair. It also helps to improve the acoustics of the room and as a sound guy, that’s something I can appreciate.  I have also recently finished a   short story  , my first one in years. It’s been a really long time since I’ve written anything but it kinda came to me one night last week. After much prodding from some friends in  urlLink Second Life , I finished it in very short order. Right now, I’m looking into adding a page to this blog to host it, so look for it when it’s officially up.   All in all I have to say it’s been a pretty good week. Just wish I didn’t have two tests waiting in the wings of next week, otherwise I could start another short story, poem or fictional story universe. The writting bug seems to have bitten. At least I don’t have to worry about my reservist call up, I got everything already packed anyway.

      It has been a fun holiday season that is now fast coming to a close. Christmas eve was stressful but the marathon session of  urlLink Chez Geek  afterwards more that made up for it.  Christmas morning was quiet, with visits to immediate family (whom we always have to visit as soon as possible during any major holiday, hence the name) and some small gift exchanging. Got a metal CD case from Mom, nice considering that I don't use CD's anymore, oh well, should be good to store harddisk backup CDs I guess. Boxing day was spent across the border with the highlight being the off-road biking tracks and the outdoor bath. The bath was a refreshing experience, at night; one can really feel like part of nature. It reminds me of my NS field camp but with better soap.  Since returning, I’ve been busy getting things ready for start of the new school year. The timing is a little off this year so it looks like some school shopping is still in order. Stuff like note-taking paper and the sort. Wish I could go paperless this year and pick up that  urlLink wireless keyboard  for my  urlLink Tungsten E , but that would depend on how much note taking there is going to be. Hopefully I won’t have to sit next to a power supply to keep my  urlLink Tungsten  juiced while typing.

Instead let your Spirit take flight, to the Joy that is the Light, and may in your mind this day be famous, and never forget this Christmas!

      One of my most found childhood memories involves sitting outside the gate outside my house at the time (before I was living in an apartment). I was sitting there reading a book, which the title I cannot now remember. I was happily reading when I noticed the darkening sky. Distracted, I stopped to watch the clouds move overhead, increasing in number, dark shapes slowly moving across, driving the light away as they go.  The wind had picked up while the clouds moved, seemingly, into position in the sky. I could see the trees swaying, leaves desperately trying to hand on to their branches, their very lifeline. Of those that had failed, they were scattered across the ground, marking the very passage of their bane, allowing the invisible to be seen.   Suddenly all was still, the wind a fading memory. The dead leaves were still, the very emptiness deafening in their silence. Slowly an echo is heard, then more, increasing in number and tempo, like a marching army approaching. Looking down the road, I see a wave of raindrops coming towards me, leaving a trail of slick in their path. Glancing in the other direction, I saw that it was still dry, yet untouched by the oncoming onslaught.  Mesmerized, I stay where I am, vulnerable book still in my lap and let the rain overrun me. After which, I set the book aside, it’s lines wrinkled, and took a long slow walk down the road, becoming one with the rain.  Since that day I had a new appreciation for the weather, rainstorms in particular. I know no other greater example of the beauty and awesome power of the Creator. But yet, it’s been a long time since I have walked in the rain, or when I am forced to, to enjoy it. Now I’m afraid for the items that I carry on myself and how the rain may spoil them, or likewise even for my appearance.  How I long for those carefree days to enjoy the rain. And I am sadden by the fact that it is my ownself and the things that I take on that prevents me from enjoying one of the greatest experiences in the world.

      Man time does fly. It’s already been 10 days since I last posted. This last month of what turned out to be quite an interesting year is just pasting me by. I have to admit that I’m a quite sad to see it go. Although I may have not been able to accomplish all that I had set out for myself to do this year, I have enjoyed it; even with all the unexpected ups and downs.   Speaking of unexpected ups…I had the delight of attending a secondary school classmate’s wedding dinner over the weekend. It seemed like a school reunion with all the old familiar faces showing up, although there were many that were…missed.  I find it unfortunate that I was not able to catch up as well as I would have liked with everyone who was there. I guess one reason was that huge dinners like these are not really conducive to speaking what with all the eating going on. Or it could be that I was constantly interrupted with discussion of my “antics” in the good ole days. Regardless, it was all agreed that we never thought that our schoolmate in question would be one of the first to get married. Time flies indeed.

      Figured it was time to do some restructuring of this place, so I was slowly going over the source codes last night. Decided that a good first step would be to try to make the place compliant with the HTML 4.01 Transitional standard and eventually work towards XHTML transitional compliance. So that means removing some tags and replacing some with another tag that basically does the same thing. It’s a good thing because I intent to keep this site around for sometime and even when I do move to my own web host, it’s going to use some lines of code from here as a reference so it’s good to start planning for the future. Besides, I need a reason to practice what I learnt during my website creation module earlier this year, although all I really learnt was focused on XHTML and just a little bit on scripts using  .jsp  and  .asp .  Speaking of website scripts, I’ve added some links to more blogs as well as removed some dead ones. One of the new blogs, is from  urlLink Beverly , who is one of the few females I have come across who is a wiz at the  Perl  scripting language. I know I’m generalizing but there doesn’t seem to be many females who are good or even like to code. I know I have met some in  urlLink Second Life , and I’m sure there are a fair even share of female graduates from computer based degrees that can code well, but to actually like it? Now that’s rare I think. And brings me to the question:  Why can’t I meet more girls like that??!! .  It’s saddens me to think that while I do know  C  and  C++ , I can’t say that I’m good at them and my frustration at the whole programming process is sapping any joy that I used to derive from writing code. That being said, I should learn  Perl  as well as  .Net . Maybe I should ask  urlLink Beverly  the best way to get started on them.  Another blog, I’ve added is from a fellow “ practitioner ” of the fabled art of    urlLink Palm  Fu  ,  urlLink Gordon . I actually know more “ practitioners ” in the  urlLink group  I used to run around that  urlLink Gordon  is also a part of but I seem to have lost touch with them. Oh well.  urlLink Gordon  is a fun and loud character to trade “fixes” with but he does have his soft side as seen in his blog.  And lastly,  urlLink Tamara . I have lost touch with her many many years ago and it’s a testament to the usefulness of things like  urlLink Friendster.com  to reconnect with long lost friends. In this case its especially meaningful cause  urlLink Tamara  did play a signification role in a point of my life. I guess I can call her a   Childhood Sweetheart  . She’ll probably smile at that. But now she has far better things to smile about for she is recently engaged! My most heartfelt congratulations to her and to her husband-to-be.

        Continued from Part 1     Snapping up the magazine, I learned that Sequencers are the heart of the digital studio (of course the computer it is running on is equally important) in the sense that it also involves recording, adding effects and even EQing and final mix-down. In other words, almost like a full studio that music producers use.   Immediately my thoughts turned towards my  church  audio setup and how a program like this could  benefit  it. With talk of doing recordings, a Sequencer plugged into the hardware mixer would be able to record the whole session into the hard disk and then allow a whole range of post-recording work such as adding effects and cleaning up some of the tracks to be done before mixing down and burning from the computer’s CD burner. Now that’s at the most basic, but going a little deeper, individual instrument tracks could be recorded and burned out on it’s own for…lets say a new guitarist who is trying to  learn  the songs? Could burn for him/her a CD containing just the guitar parts for various songs all played by the current guitarist, which they can take home to listen and practice at home. And this could be done for every instrument (with exception of the drums since it’s not miked up).   Another area would be the Sequencer’s ability to take classical music notation and display it a MIDI overview for play back and study. It can even take notes inputted from a MIDI keyboard and change it to classical music notation, which can then be printed out for distribution. This would be very useful for music  composition .   With all this very interesting ideas, it would be good to find out how much actually obtaining it would be. But even this was hampered by the fact that audio software doesn’t seem to be sold off the shelves here. Therefore I was forced to email the local distributors requesting for price lists. Looking at the prices online in US$ and Euro, the price ranges from a little over 1K for the high end products, above $500 for the mid-level and around $300 for the entry-level stuff which are limited in certain areas such as the lack of the ability to handle classical notation. All it all, it kind of reminds me of the price difference between levels in most personal electronic devices such as handphones, PDAs and digital cameras.   In the meantime, I just settle with learning from the demo versions, and about the other types of audio software such as soft synths were one can create new sounds and sample mixers where bits of different audio samples are mixed and tweaked to form complete tracks. Useful for when one feels creative and would like to actually have a finish product to actually listen to and enjoy and even distribute to others.  Phew! There is so much more I can talk about this, but I already had to spilt this into two posts and I’m learning more each time. Guess I better end here. But I shall leave some links if anyone wants further information or if anyone knows more about all this, I’m all ears for tips and new areas to discover…who knows? Maybe in a few months time, I could have some of my own stuff to post up here. Just hope I don’t end up cranking out the usual techno crap.

      Very late post again. Meh.  Guess since this was so late, i shall make it a long one. Might just occupy one enough until the next one.  What I have been busy with over the last week or so, is research into my latest hobby/fad/craze. Yes yes, I know you have heard it all before. Like whatever happened to all those photos that I was to take with my digital camera? Well I do take them, just haven’t really gotten around to finding a good place to host all of them. Not to worry, the camera is still being put to frequent use. On top of that, the research is not just for selfish reasons, as I will explain later.  It all began with an  urlLink article  I came across in  urlLink Wired.com  middle of last year. It spoke about how this “world-famous” (only if you like techno I gather since I have never heard of him before) DJ was using Mac G4 laptops and, in particular, software called “ urlLink Ableton Live ” in his sets. I found it interesting that software had reached a point where techno music composers where using it, but then again, they have always been known for using sounds from almost anything that beeps into their stuff. Since I don’t like techno, it didn’t arouse my curiously that much, on top of that, it was running on a Mac (not that I have anything against Macs…oh wait, I do…) which are way out of my price range. So I made a quick link to the  urlLink Ableton  website but didn’t visit it then and, of course, I promptly forgot about it.   Fast forward to late November, and I was just going through my favorites links folder when I came across the link to the  urlLink Ableton  website. I said “what the hay!” (Cause I felt like horsing around) and visited the website. I took a tour of the features of the Live software and listened to the samples of what it could do. In short, I was totally blown away. I never knew that audio software had reached such a level (and best of all it has a PC version) and could be such a factor in what I always thought was dominated by hardware. So I grabbed a download of the demo version tried it out a few times and once again forgot about it. This time school distracted me, so that’s not really such a bad thing. But the software had made an impression on me and I told myself that I had to go back and look deeper into it when I have the time.  Late December, always a busy time of the year, and I was presented with News that I was to fully take over the handling of the  Audio and Sound Ministry  in  Church . Scary. But that’s the case for any increase of responsibility, just have to take it and run with it the best you can. First thing that came to mind was how to improve on what we already have, of course first focus was on how to make full use of the hardware we already have, but my thoughts turned towards the software side and what better time than now to find out what is really out there that can help. Boy was I not prepared for what I would find.  After searching the Net for sometime (finding dead ends at all the Djing and beat mixing sites) I came across  urlLink this site , which focused more on the recording, composing, editing and producing areas of music. Very much more my can of coke. But going through the “guides” and reviews, I was overwhelmed by the load of information. There seemed to be different categories of software involved, combined with obscure hardware modules and its own brand of jargon that is not really explained. Usually stuff like this is no problem for me, I mean I find it equally relaxing and entertaining going over the rules and concepts of RPG books and reading a normal novel. And anyone who knows RPGs know the sheer amount of jargon that goes along with that as well.  So even as I went through the information put forward in the website and in the accompanying forums, I decided to keep a look out for other sources of information. A chance visit to  Tower Records  at Suntec, because  Da Man  wanted to buy the “ Love Actually ” soundtrack to go along with his “ Love Actually ” screenplay novel (it’s strange how I completely blew past the hype surrounding the movie, I guess my romantic spirit has taken a more cynical and less naïve outlook on relationships), had me stumble across the magazine section, where I came across the  Digital Music Maker  series of special edition magazines that focus on one particular software at a time. In this the first issue, the focus was on  urlLink Steinberg Cubase SX 2 , which from my research is said to be one of the most popular and well-known software Sequencers currently on the market.

      Here's a sample of the various birthday "well wishes" I heard over the course of the day:  "It's your birthday again? Man that was fast..."  "Dude! Happy 23! Enjoying the good life?"  "Err..I'm 25 now" "Really!? wow...that sucks..."  "Welcome to the downhill slope towards 30!"  "Quarter of a century already. So what have you done with your life?"  "So you are now on the wrong side of the twenties like I am. Enjoy!"  ..Sigh..

      Once again, the one thing I am reminded to learn from the start of this new year, is not to take things for granted. Time is not kind to any of us and if we are not careful, it can overwhelm us, overtake us and leave us alone and bewildered.  Take a good look in the mirror of your heart and soul and realize that you should not take yourself for granted. If there is something you see there that you don't like, take steps to change it. If you don't see anything wrong, then challenge yourself, upgrade or start something new. Take a chance.  Take a good look at the people around you, putting off that outing? Haven't spoken to in months? Pick up the phone, buy that lunch. Especially for the people overseas of which I'm sure we know many. The long months can be brutal.  Take a good look at one's family, there are there for a reason. We are to learn alot from them, one way or another and don't just remained focused on the ones near you. Be thankful for extended families. Do not be content on seeing them just once or twice a year.  And lastly, remember those that are no longer with us. Smile in the memories that we have, but use them to move forward to the future. Take what we have learnt from them and put them into use. The best way to honor their memory.

      Major update time again. I keep saying that if people where to complain more about me not updating this, I’ll be all the more driven to do so. This does not seem to be the case this week with  IrsSm  being the one to make noise about it. Maybe it’s just her :)   Nahh..just kidding. It’s good to have readers again. Yes all three of you. Once again I have to tout the usefulness of  urlLink Friendster , however, while for most it allows them to make new friends, for me it seems to be more limited to catching up with old ones. Not that I’m complaining of course. I have always been more concern with losing old ones than making new ones.

      Never really one to follow the Lunar calendar, I am however tickled that this is the year of the monkey. I mean, who would name a year after such a chaotic creature due to the very fact that they are the smartest animal around? (arguably the smartest if you take humans into account...actually now that I think about it...) Or maybe it's because I just find monkeys funny. Well whatever the case it seems to me that you're just asking for trouble if you call anything "monkey". I'm pretty sure even the monkeys take offence at it.  In light of this, the Chinese New Year celebrations passed without much trouble or fanfare. Other than the fact that it is exceptionally early this year. Not that I'm complaining of course. Celebrate the New Year twice in the same month? No Problem! Not that I would actually go out and party...that would be so unlike me.  At the end of it all, I realize that I should spend more time with my cousins. I seem to learn something new from them every year. Simple exchange of information that would point me towards a useful resource or idea, I hope to make sure that I'm able to give a useful piece of advice myself each time.  Speaking of spending more time with people, I'm finally settling down and getting to know my fellow coursemates.Of course there will always be the odd cliche here and there but all in all it's a pretty good group. Of note is the fact that more than half of them are forgien students, mainly from Indonsia and Malaysia, which means I'm actually exposed to different cultures and countries without having to go study overseas like I originally planned. Not bad. I hope to be able to get to know them better for we all may not continue taking the same modules throughout the whole year.  As the schoolwork piles up and the projects, assignments and tests approach, I will have to start focusing more firmly on them. This does not bode well for my new interest in Computer Music and production for it also requires a substansial amount of time to be invested in overcoming the learning curve. Oh well, we will have to see how it goes.

      Finally updated the  urlLink Writings  page with a work in process and some other ideas that I have flying around in my head. Currently working on   The Cure   in between whatever free time I got between studying and assignments. But I think it would be good to gather some feedback on what story to work on next after I’m done with this one. All the better to plan ahead with. Lord knows I need it. Would like to focus on trying a hand at making music using the digital tools at my diposoal, but it seems to be a far more time consuming method of expression, so I'm not totally eliminating writting for fun.   Anyway go to the  urlLink Writings  page and check out the short synopsis for each story and let me know which one you would like to read more about and I’ll focus on that one. Feel free to use the comments link below.

       quick update   Guess I spoke too soon. I logged in into SecondLife this morning, bumped into my friends and they were able to talk me through testing my setup on the test radio server. I was one of the easiest thing ever and soon they could hear my Winamp playlist going and even my mike setup seemed to be fine, maybe a bit loud but thats better than being too soft.  Now armed with my password and login, I'm all set to start Djing, all thats left is to find and book a good time slot. Easier said than done with the time difference and my oncoming workload. Just have to play it by ear, pardon the pun.

       sigh.  Looks like the DJing gig for  urlLink Slive.net  in Second Life is dead in the water. It’s been increasingly difficult to meet up with the people who run said station to discuss details. I would like to conduct it as soon as possible in order to circumvent the assignment deadlines and tests to study for that are pilling up this month. Oh well, at least I got permission to play songs by  Pension State  if I ever do get the gig. Thanks PS guys.

      It has been more than a week since the collapse of Nicoll Highway over here at what marks to be the first major disaster of the year. I’m not sure about the rest of you guys, but over the last few years I noticed that there will always be an incident that "marks" the year in our memories (and of course the media doesn’t help) and sometimes there will be a mark for the first half of the year, and another in the last half, sort of like a way to distinguish how the year in question moved from bad to worse, or from bad to better.  I’m sure all the advertising, media and sociologist reoriented people are interested in finding out the factors that contribute to having people collectively remember a subject in identical terms that is then linked to form an opinion of another, but that’s beyond the scope of this post (or my brain of that matter). You know, I think there actually is a term for this kind of "massively inducted memories". Someone care to enlighten me?  As mentioned above, the last few years have had their fare share of incidents that has affected lives here, but this one for this year is different. While the previous ones such as less people traveling and health awareness because of SARS and bird flu have had a direct effect on our economy, the Highway incident is something more inconspicuous and yet the effect could be more long-lasting. In this case, it affects the infrastructure.  While the closure of the highway is at best a minor inconvenience many, especially in the east, felt its effect. This only hints at what possible widespread effect could occur and how fragile our infrastructure actually is. The possible problem is further cascaded with the incident affecting the whole new MRT line, with the project being held up indefinitely as safety checks and new plans are drawn up. While not having the new line itself is not much of a problem, the fact that all the construction that has already been started would be left open and thus compound the weakness of the infrastructure for a much longer period. For the very nature of building something, dictates that the item in question lies in a weaken state until it is completed.  I guess we can only hope and pray that the situation is still under control and that we would not be caught in this "limbo" while it drains our reserves and undermines our infrastructure. The circle line MRT project was perhaps pushed too hard. Maybe more restraint is needed.

      Hmm. Now this is kinda interesting. As a long time user of blogger I have just been given my own  urlLink Gmail  account from Google. Of course this is the very same Gmail service thats been making the rounds in the Tech news because of the 1Gig worth of email space as well as the controversial google supported ads appearing along the side bar that are based on your emails. In other words, the system would scan ones email that is stored in the servicel and then show advertisments that match keywords found in the emails, thereby creating personalized advertisments which some people feel is an invasion of privacy.  I'm all up to testing it for a couple of months in this close beta testing period. I have already listed it here on this blog as the email address to contact me with and I have forwarded my secondary email accounts to it. However, I'm reluctant to forward my main mail account to Gmail, for the simple fact that most of my mail is spam anyway due to using it to subscribe to too many mailing list and newsletters over the past 7 years. Really should have gotten a secondary account for all that back then.  Quite pleased that I managed to get an account, I remember being one of the first testers for Google back when they we still in beta. Always had a soft spot for Google since then. It does help that they are now the search engine of choice.  All in all...this should be quite interesting to see how things turn out. The only problem I forsee is that I somehow forgot to change the default Gmail email address given and now I can't change it.

      Heh. Pardon the pun of a title. But yeah, I just finished my most dreaded Advance Database exam yesterday. No more having to deal with lost updates again. Hopefully.   Speaking of which I am somewhat surprised that I actually found it to be not as terrible a paper that I thought it would be. As I walked out of the exam room, I had this uneasy feeling that I must have done something wrong, because it just didn’t register to my mind and fit what I expected it to be.  I have had this sensation before, but never this profound before. Once again I’m reminded of how much someone upstairs must like me. Once again it’s not by my strength but by His. I should never forget this one fact.  So now it’s on to a well deserved break. Will be looking to updating here more often. Got lots of thoughts I should be putting up here. If I can remember them all that is.

      *bleah* long long gap between updates.  I just finished up a round of two tests and a mega irritating assignment. Still got one more assignment to finish up by mid-week then I'm all done and can settle down for a short break over the Easter weekend.  Really wish I could have spent more time studying for my tests than working on the assignment most of the time. Looks like I won't be getting those A's like I did last year. Funny how back in poly my final year was the best year for me, and not in just grades. Oh well, whats done is done. Must focuson the exams next.  And thats all I got to say about that. I really got to stop talking about school and work so much. I mean I'm sure no one wants to read about that. Thats why I have always used "selective posting" and only post when I feel there is something to discuss and not the boring daily drudge. For thats what my life is like mostly, a boring daily drudge and thats never interesting to read about.

      Once again this week has totally just flown by. Generally uneventful, there were some interesting happenings.  Dropped by the airport early in the week and was once again reminded of why I once enjoyed that place. No other place I know where it is both crowded and yet has quiet places, has wide open-spaces and yet have long empty winding corridors. Helps that it opens till late and is only a quick bus ride from home and back. However there are some sad memories that may have kept me away, but I understand that there are good ones as well. Things are changing.

      On a whim, I decided to drop by the airport on my way back from class today. It was still kinda early and I was feeling to groove because of the good music mix from my Nomad but most importantly because I happened to have my Cybershot with me. Been awhile since I took any new pictures and had forgotten alot of techniques and settings tips. But I think they turned out pretty ok.    urlLink    Of Steel and Glass      urlLink    Loney Walkways      urlLink    The Endless Search      urlLink     At the Plane beyond

      Attended the first Church produced music theory-training lesson two days ago. Was surprised that I actually remembered stuff from my drum lessons during my poly days at the great old Suntec Music Plaza back before they moved. Good memories. Especially the time where I ran into  DaMan  there when we both were with our respective SO at the time.   Heh  . So anyway the lesson was just basically a refresher course but it was good to see the younger ones that are really new to music theory have a go at learning it. Quite fun, I hope they will keep at it. Always have a place for new instrument players, and if they don’t make it on to the Worship team, well my Sound team would be more than willing to take them in.    As for myself, well…I think I need to talk to  CrlSh  about what I want to get out of the lessons. I’m mainly in it for the theory, but don’t mind picking up some keyboard skills. However I’m not looking to actually play up on stage, its more for me to experiment with at home, to know what notes sound good together and what should follow after each note.  In the meantime, I’ve did some searching on the Net for stuff on music theory and came up with an interesting link.   urlLink Musictheory.net   It has a series of lessons done in flash that are quite in depth. Some of them even has sound and there are trainers to help test one's knowledge. Haven't had much time to go throught it yet. Wonder how much I can pick up on my own.

       urlLink       Well it's the start of a whole new week as we barrel straight towards the end of the month. Can't believe it's almost already the middle of the year. Time really files fast. Sometimes I feel like I'm stuck in the past.  On that note, after last week, my mind is starting to finally open up to new possibilities and outlooks. But somehow I'm left feeling like a guy on a huge coffee craving but only has one Starbucks in his town...and they only have tea. Where do I even begin searching?

      Man...the surprises from blogger just keep coming. After re-vamping the whole interface and adding much sort after features like comments. They then throw in a photoblogging service that allows photos to be posted with just a few clicks and no html. Just like the one in the post below.  There are other additional features to the service as well that is pretty cool. Such as direct connection to your friends to share photos and chat with them about it MSN/ICQ style. So no more trying to find ways for  DaMan  to show off to me his photos from his latest holiday (all 9megs worth), we just both connect using the  urlLink hello client   and he can show me each photo at time, discuss them while both of us are viewing the same picture (so no more misunderstandings) and I can then op to save to my disk which photos I want.  Totally cool. If there is anything that can get me back into using my digital camera more often, this would be it. I highly recommend this to anyone with a digital camera, don't forget to add me to your list.

      For some strange reason, this has been at the back of my mind over the last few days. More so than usual. And now I discover... How long? two? four? No notice and no further follow up offered...for good? and what about the other? left behind?  Too many questions, not enough answers... now flying in my mind.  I don't want to dwell too much. I can't dwell too much. I can't afford to dwell too much. I won't allow it...I just can't.  It's time and yet I don't hunger. I'm not afraid of the answers, only of not having them at all...

      Picked up the latest copy of  urlLink Computer Music Magazine , the other day and was quite pleased to see that it was a special beginners issue. It wouldn't be out of place if they had called named it with this above title.  Basically what this issue does is to give a detailed introducing to the world of using computers to not only record but also to create, mix, produce and even master music for personal use. In most cases the stuff done can also be applied to professional studios as well.  Now as I have mentioned before ( urlLink here  and  urlLink here ), at the start of the year I had taken up to learn more about computer music as an extension of my duties as a sound engineer, to find ways to improve or booster the sound equipment in Church and for personal enrichment as well.  But things have not been working out as well as I have figured, there are tons of information that need to be understood and compiled from many sources, too many choices in hardware and software and most things assume knowledge in music playing and theory of which I have…well…none. It’s all very disheartening. It also doesn’t help that all the solutions that I discovered to help out in Church is mainly only possible with a sizeable budget, of which I have none.  So I have not been keeping up to date on the scene much with school and such keeping me occupied. But I guess with this issue a fresh start can be taken. Perhaps I shouldn’t rush headlong into trying to figure out the higher end stuff and perhaps start slow towards the low end first. I am taking some basic music theory courses and so that would hopefully arm me with greater know-how to make better use of my MIDI keyboard instead of just banging away at it.  Basically it comes down to making the most of what I have at the moment and not worry too much about other stuff. These things take time and so I just have to stick to it and then I’ll slowly see the benefits as I build up my foundations.

      Well the one-week break practically flew past and I'm already at the end of the second week of my new school term. With some of the modules requiring weekly assignments, this term looks to be a killer. But then again I always say that at the start of each new term.

      Well. I've changed some things around. It retains the look of the original template, but I think the feel is different. It's more me now.  I'm very pleased that each post has it's own page now. Makes things all so much more neater and easier to implement other pages with the same layout. But that means I'll have to go back through all of them to correct some layout problems. Irratic font sizes seem to be the major problem at the moment. I'll have to dig through the style sheets to figure out why it's happening.  Of course I'll still have to put up all the links that I used to have on the old layout. That will be the next item to be added soon.  So tell me what you think of the new layout and test out the new comments system while you're at it.

      Well. How fun. Here I am preparing a post about how I used the web page validator at www.wc3.com and what does Google and Blogger do? Completely revamp the service, including new templates that meet all the latest standards. Boy does it save me alot of time but it does force the need to implement changes like well...now.  This template is only a placeholder for the moment, I quite like it but think I will need to add my own touches to it soon, like a little less blue. Of course the old tag-board and comments are gone. No big lost really. The tag-boards keep crashing and having pop-up appear and the comments were practically unused. Will be using the new Blogger comments system but I don't think I'll be putting the tag-board back.  As for the profile, writting page and links. I will work to getting them up as soon as I can. Lots of stuff to adjust and learn. Would be fun if I didn't already have some stuff on hand to do.

        My hopes are so high that your  kiss  might kill me. So won't you  kill  me, so I die happy. My heart is  yours  to fill or burst, to  break  or bury, or wear as jewelery, which ever you prefer.  Hands down this is the best day I can  ever  remember, I'll always  remember  the sound of the stereo, the dim of the  soft  lights, the  scent  of your hair that you twirled in your fingers and the time on the clock when we realized it's  so  late and this walk that we shared  together . The streets were  wet  and the  gate  was locked so I jumped it, and I let you  in . And you stood at your door with your  hands  on my waist and you kissed me like you meant it. And  I knew  that you meant it, that you  meant  it, that you meant it,  and I  knew, that  you meant , it that you meant  it .     -Taken from "Hands Down" by Dashboard Confessional

      Well I spoke to some of the Techs at  Pac Net  and it seems like they have fixed that error 400 redirecting problem that have been plaguing the blog over the last few weeks. So far so good, so major upz to them for fixing it.  On that note, I just realized that the renew date on the personal domain name had indeed run out, but  Pac Net , having good customer service, has automatically renewed it for another year. So it looks like I won’t be looking for a new web host anytime soon. Maybe towards the end of the year, when I have gotten my money’s worth of the renewal fee and itching to expand the site again, then I’ll bring it up again.  Till then…it’s good to be back.

      Well for more than a week, an error would have prevented most people from visiting this blog. Not that there are alot of visitors in the first place.  I had figured it to be a problem with the re-directing service from Pacific Internet and that they would fix it after a few days. However as it turns out the problem lay with how they handled the URL to be directed to, which required a change in the settings, of which I only discovered today after much testing. However it seems like this only solves the problem for a short while, then it pops up again. Really looks like a problem server side. Hopefully they will fix it soon but in the meantime I’m looking into finding a new web host for the site. Having trouble coming up with a good domain name though. Any Ideas anyone?

      Coming off the restlessness that I was feeling over the weekend, I decided to pick up again, book 5 of the  Harry Potter  series,  The Order of the Phoenix . Having watched the latest movie last week, and realizing that I had only read the book once on the day of its release, guessed it wouldn't hurt to go through it again. Well other than the fact that I need to catch up on my school reading, do my weekly journal and get ready my army stuff, it shouldn't hurt. Yeah Right.  About halfway through the book already, I'm reminded of some reviews that I had read about the book. While I may agree that the book is a little long-winded, and the pace somewhat off at spots, I don't agree that it is the weakness in the series. While it may not be as good as  The Goblet of Fire , and the plot not as strong as  The Prisoner of Akzaban , it is not as weak as  The Chamber of Secrets , the weakness of the series in my opinion. Good thing that the movie done it good.  Speaking of which, its only natural that I found the movie for  Prisoner of Azkaban  to be the best of the lot, having a better overall plot, much stronger acting and a style of directing that fits the new direction that the plot heads towards. I can't wait to see the movie (or movies) that come out of  The Goblet of Fire , still my favorite book. Another good thing about the whole series is that hopefully people would follow the spelling of my real name as given in the books. It’s one “L” not two.  *grins*   Well hopefully i can finish off the book by tonight, get my fix and then get on with the business of school and service to the nation.

      Came down with some flu today and feeling quite urgh about the whole thing. No mood to do anything really. Hate it when I’m in these sort of moods. Hopefully it will pass by soon. I’ve got magazines and textbooks to read, games to play and a bed to sleep in, yet I’m struggling to write out something here.

       " Yet another sign that the End of the World as we know it is approaching"       Yep you heard it right. I have doomed us all.  I have turned my back on my brothers and have fallen into the  White .    Yes.I have bought a Mac product.    An iPod actually. 20Gigs, 4th generation. All white plastic and shiny chrome.  It's simple to use, does what it's made for well, turn on;plug in; forget it's there.    It's good. Not perfect. But good.    Yet I don't see what all the hype is about. Haven't made a Mac convert out of me. Heck it doesn't change my views on computing towards the Mac mindset either. Frankly I was more "enlighten" when I bought my first Palm PDA.    That being said, have to give credit due to Apple for a nicely made piece of tech.  If this is the device that makes people more aware of the joys of digital music, so be it. We could do alot worse.    Well I did say that I would talk about my issues with Apple if I did end up buying an iPod. Not everyone wants to hear it I know, but at least it will allow me to actually put down on paper my views. I'll try to do it soon.

      Over the last few days I have been taking a close look at  urlLink Mp3 players  as I have been in the market to replace my aging  urlLink Nomad II . It’s amazing; the little thing has been with me for almost 8 years now. It predates all my hand phones and PDA’s, most of Poly and all of Army. It even outlasted two girlfriends.  Now that’s what I call loyalty.  So the best that I can do is find a suitable successor and finally put the little guy down to rest. Seeing as how it came from  urlLink Creative , it’s only natural that they are my first choice for a replacement and that only a hard disk based player with gigs of space would justify retiring the Nomad.  However over the years, the products from Creative have been intriguing but somewhat lacking. The first jukebox series seemed like the CD players of old and the Zen series, while being a big innovation, just seems like an external hard disk. Not to mention that they all lack the easy one-handed operation of the Nomad.  How about the competition?  urlLink iRiver  and  urlLink Apple  being the only alternatives worth considering.   iRiver contains the best feature set but at extravagant prices when compared to the amount of space they are offering.  As for Apple? Expanding from my general resentment of their views on computer culture and product development, I find their offerings to focus too much on style and design over technical aspects and compatibility for such a premium price.  So back to the present, Creative is coming out with their new player and it looks they finally came up with something that is usable and not too big. Of course they did this by copying almost full scale from Apple, so they lose points there. And what’s with the vertical touch bar? I not sure if that would be easy to use.  And Apple? The  urlLink iPod minis  are cute and have the right idea in terms of navigation but are not value for money. Then I saw the new  urlLink 4th generation iPod  and I have to admit.  I am  impressed .  Seems to me with this, Apple have finally fixed what have, in my eyes, been wrong with their whole line till now.  No more awkward placed buttons, now they almost match the configuration of my old Nomad. And of course the touch wheel is still there, a trademark of the iPod and somewhat gimmicky to me, but its a tried and found to be practical method and I'm all for practicability. Better battery life, which Apple previously ignored to maintain the seek look of the old iPods, yet another decision of theirs that I disagreed with. And finally, Windows and USB support right out of the box, so no more ignoring the bigger percentage of computer users.  In short, I’m actually considering buying a Mac product.  I know. I'm as surprised as you are.  My one consolation is that it seems that this is the most disliked iPod among current Mac users. They call it a step away from what makes Mac a Mac, that it is too mainstream. But that is actually the reason why I like it.  It strikes me that I should explain the history of my dislike for Apple one day. Especially if I do end up buying an iPod.  Till then, the first salvo in the digital music battle for my money has been fired.

      I’m glad to finally have back on air, about the only “reality” TV show that I can stand to watch hence my favorite,  The Amazing Race .  However it looks like  urlLink this season , it’s going to go to extremes. Either someone screws up so badly that it becomes the highlight of the season, or it’s so unmemorable that no one will bother about it weeks after the final show. Of course it’s only the first episode so as yet anything can happen.   However it’s the people that make the show and compared to last season, this season’s 2 person teams almost seem normal. Sure, we have the requisite young, good-looking, comprised of at least one model, couple (or two, or three, or four!?) and the network tried to spice things up by throwing in mothers, pilot, twins and a midget but they are still lacking compared to the clowns, blondes, virgins, gays and surfer dudes of  urlLink yester season .   Now I’m not saying that it’s gimmicks that sell the show, far from it. I’ve always believed that it’s how the teams run the race that matters. In the first episode, the teams already seemed “blessed” by lousy vision, stronger than the norm ability to follow written instructions and copious amounts of backstabbing that didn’t serve any purpose. In contrast, the above-mentioned red-nosed wonder clowns ran a near prefect race. They were eager, quick to move, hardly missed a clue, were good at almost all the events, rarely argued, were nice to other teams when it mattered and was actually funny to boot. It was only by a single mistake that led to their exit late in the race but they still remain my favorite team in any season.  So here’s hoping that these teams improve on their race skills, but I think they will have an easier time trying to show some character. Until then I’ll be honking my bright red nose at them.   urlLink Here is  a good site to read the latest episode recap. Beware that it can be bitingly honest of the team’s performance. More so than even I can stand to be.

      ...at least it sure feels like it. 2 weeks between posts. Not even the excuse of being cut out from the Net due to my Internet router failing and having to be replaced sounds good enough.  That being said, I'm totally enjoying the new router that I picked up today. Heard alot about  urlLink Netgear  products but never had the chance to try because of their much higher price. But nowadays prices for networking devices are so low that they are all about the same level anyways. Best thing is that it came bundled with a laptop wireless card, which I passed to my mom, for only a small sum.
