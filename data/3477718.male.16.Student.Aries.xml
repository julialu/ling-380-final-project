      Last goodbye (C) MDH  Life it seems is fading far, far away. Im done trying, So todays the day. I've decided to give up my mothers pride and joy. I will no longer be called her little boy. No more tears streamming down my face. No more being labled such a disgrace. So as I leave there will be no golden sun. No shining star. I've convinced myself, I've gone too far. The gun to my head, the tears in my eye. I've left this world without saying goodbye. -------------------------------------------- Give me your input on it guys.
