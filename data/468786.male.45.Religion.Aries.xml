       urlLink    Thought about this lately? Be encouraged today!   Hebrews 4:12 (NLT)       For the word of God is full of living power. It is sharper than the sharpest knife, cutting deep into our innermost thoughts and desires. It exposes us for what we really are.

       Would you love a week guided by God gaining confidence in your Christian walk each day? Remember God is on your side! Our Father loves us more than we can even comprehend! Let His "strong arm" rule your choices this week!   Isaiah 26:3 (NLT)    You will keep in perfect peace all who trust in you,    whose thoughts are fixed on you!

       I saw this and thought of how unique and precious we are in the sight of God. He loves you very much ... won't you let him bring peace into your life right now?    urlLink    Psalm 139:14 (NIV)       I praise you because I am fearfully and wonderfully made;         your works are wonderful,         I know that full well.

       In the Bible, you see David who is said to have a heart after God constantly seek to get back to the source. Without God all perspective changes, we are week in our thinking and wisdom. Without God we are lacking in our optimism and failing in our answers to life's challenges.       Psalm 54:4 (NLT)  But God is my helper. The Lord is the one who keeps me alive!       Getting back to the basics, where God is our first choice in all of our decisions and allowing His viewpoint into our daily living ... well it brings life into our journey. Seek the Lord's help today no matter what comes your way.    .... You can leave your own comment - just click on the link below this message
