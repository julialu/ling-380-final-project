       urlLink    To make sure we're clear, that means "THIS IS A NO POLITICS BLOG". That is the new, and only, rule. You political whores. It's a rule I made up just now because politics just aren't entertaining. Hell, it isn't even a rule. It's a request. A plea.  3 political related entries in less than 48 hours? Even if one of those was obviously a parody, I  really hate politics.  "The Democratic National Convention" is not a punchline. "Because the cloroform wore off" is a punchline. For what joke, I do not know. It probably involves Abe Lincoln and your sister, even if you don't have one. YOU'RE FILTHYING UP THE SEMI-POINTLESS BLOG WE HAVE HERE! Politics are about as funny as Family Circus. By that I mean I'd rather gnaw away a dead woman's wrinkles, and  no,  I'm not a necrophiliac, so I wouldn't derive any pleasure form gobbling away someone's grandmother's jowels. If I continue like this, it might get worse than that god awful paris hilton rant down a few entries which included the horrid word "dick" and wasn't even a rant.  Not short for "Richard", no, I'm afraid not. "Tiddly winker" or even "johnson" would be better than "dick". However, the term "bee's knees" was used in that rant,as well as "THANKS YOU INTERNET. THANKS YOU". That goofy usage of grammar cracks me up, so I'll forget about it. I have no problem with rants, however, which should be quite apparent. I also have no problems with anything else, as can be seen by the fact that i posted a  giant isopod threatening mankind .  I just don't think  " jokes "  about how bad Georgy Bush the Second is of a president,  how Abraham Lincoln slept with your sister, or anything involving those Demorepublicrat groups, are funny. Well, maybe the Lincoln one is. This wraps up said 5:57 anno meridian rant. It was pretty damned fun to compose, I might add.  I hope I didn't piss any of you off, because you all know where I live and sleep.    -ACK-ACK-ACK-ACK-ACK-ACK-ACK-ACK-ACK-ACK-ACK-ACK-ACK-

         On one of the first days, there was light (or something).   Now there are giant isopods, and with them comes the end of human reign.  I wish it could be prevented, but not even Sean Connery in his Zardoz attire can stop this one.

      One might remember when everything in the world was black and white.  All you have to do it turn on the TV and switch to a channel showing old shows, and there's the proof.  This is my black and white tribute, getting rid of all that halabaloo about color.  Seems there's a bit of an octo fetish here too...     PS - the weird thing on the bottom is him spinning a plate on a stick.  FYI

      History is always fun,  especially  when by history you mean urban legend, and by urban legend you mean crap made up to sell cothing. Capitalism is grand, ain' it. Hitler knew it, and so should you.      Now, if only he wasn't a mass-mudering fuckhead...
