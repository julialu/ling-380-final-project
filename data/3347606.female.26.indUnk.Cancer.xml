      "your friendly neighbourhood spiderman"...comin alive from comics once again, this hero is back wif its cobweb stunts, clad in his uncomfortable?? spidey costumes...  i m sure how many gals would envy mary jane...yearning to be loved by a hero...anyway how many can have such fairy-taled ending rite...to be kissed by a price and live happily ever after...Common gEt oUt og the way...how old fashioned thinking is this....fairy tales only belong to where they belong, fairytales...wake up...  ya...dreams are stil dreams...which would only make one seem so unrealistic...ya, jus say it...childish...give that gal a beer....the real world is yet for you to uncover...i am well aware of this cruel truth...but now...at least....i m stil stuck in the cobweb of hero-fantasy....which could only be untangled by....u guess....yes, a hero...how sad...=(

      Something's not right. No idea wat exactly..just something's not right. I feel hot all over....my whole body feels hot, hands and legs feel hot..but my forehead isn't...thats the whole mystery...I noe i m having a fever but yet...the thermometer jus cant capture it...cos its not fevering at the rite place!! wats dat!!!  All these lead me into doing wierd thgs...in the middled of the nite, i spreaded a slice of cold bread wioth cold kaya and dump into my mouth...i held cubes of ice in my hands....in the wee morning, I gloasted in frozen yoguhurt ice cream with frozen strawberries...then to finish it off, i gulped in a plass of cold milk tea and had a freezing shower...  Imagine...a warrior armoured in snow suit...walking through thick fiery forext fire....thats wat i m trying to do...pls dun melt as yet...

      yes! I want to do something different. somehow, somewhat my life still feels a missing piece...like an unsolved jigjaw puzzle. "I want to contribute back to the society. I want to do something meaningful. All the competitve politics in the working world just isn't for me." Prison Officer. Counsellor. Writer. Air Stewardess. These are the few sifted career choices of mine.     De mor      alised.     One word which describes all of my feeling at this point of time. Get back onto the track and keep trying.   I will...soon...

      what the heck is this man!! 2 big blows at one go...argghhh!!!  2 bloody jerks! but i dunno where my initial strength come from?  spoke the words i neber would have said.  ask the questions i neber would have asked.  sad of cos.but only at that point.  now i m like a freed bird...granted freedom.  now i guess i noe&nbsp;y breakups always happen on bday.  on that special day, u r somehow bestowed with the unspeakable power, unseen n unheard. yet strong enuff to cushion you from all the pain n hurt.  listen out guys: I m single and available now!!!  but who says i wanna go into a rship.  no spare me please...

      Even before the clock struck 12, my mood level was below minus. I know i cant allow this to happen...a few min more its my day... yet at the stroke of 12, my heart dive into the deepest end, tears were fighting back in my eyes... the once-hurt feeling was brought back the the surface and given a few more stabs. i finally cried. no this is not a bad sign for the beginning of my new bday year. its a detoxifying remedy i always had needed. get it straight, cry out&nbsp; and forget abt it.... but i stil choose to hate him and never in my life shall i going to forgive him. Fullstop. The sun is a reminder that everyday is a new day with new hopes. i will be fine soon. promise.

I was told that i could make my first $1million down my career path. **my dream house...all the material stuffs began forming an aura around me** *poke* Back to reality... I m still now officially "unemployed" [=(]. I need to regugate those sudden compliments and decide if i m really into that job. guess u guys wondering wat's the job that pays so well man... well....its those financial planning stuff if u'd guessed...n the co starts wif 'Pr....". guess u guys smart enuff to hav more or less figured it out. anyway, enuff of this.

                           A goal which you may have been working towards for a long time might still seem very distant right now, Ser. Therefore, today you could actually find yourself giving up on it. This doesn't, however, imply that what you want will never happen. In fact, sometimes letting go of a dream can actually cause it to manifest. Remember this when you start to brood on your lack of success so far. All is not hopeless!

      Sob sob. I failed again. Got a few response saying "Your qualifications were impressive...blahbahblah...but we regret to inform you that your application has not been successful....blahblahblah...." This is going to get abit hard for to swallow soon. I guess. Few blows at a go. Excuse me, I have a morale and esteem to uphold. But it had just been pricked, stepped and ramppaged into dozens of shattered wounds. I think I am going to bury myself back in my newfound love, searching for some much-needed solace and may I recover in time.  =`(
