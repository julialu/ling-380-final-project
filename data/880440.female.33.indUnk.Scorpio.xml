With all the publicity of the "rape" that happened in November. I'm wondering if they are going to have a reunion special like all the others have done before them. What the heck I'm nosey. LOL!

Yes I am over weight but dang I'm not ready for that step! Ironically she didn't even weigh me this visit so she doesn't know how much I've lost. :P Can you say loopy? Anyway she wants blood work done. So I will be doing that on the weekend.  Joy!
