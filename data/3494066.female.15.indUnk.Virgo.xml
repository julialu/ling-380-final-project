        Hi Guys! well.. not alot has happened lately but i'm glad we don't have to go to school tomorrow. okay well yesterday, i went to MUCKLESHOOT CASINO on sat; not to gamble but to eat lol. Well... when we were there i had to use the restroom and right when i opened the door that said "restroom" there was this lady sitting on the toliet screaming at the sight of me. I said sorry and closed the door real fast and stood there all embarrassed. To make it even more embarassing my whole family saw what happened I feel really bad for her but it was her fault she didn't lock the door!   Today.. i went shopping with my mom we went to OLD NAVY. I got a couple of stuff.. after that we went to SEARS because my uncle bought a new lawn mower and he needed to put it in my mom's van. When we were there i looked at some clothes and tried them on. When I was trying it on, I heard my mom telling me we had to go so i rushed and little did i know i wore my shirt inside out. NO one told me about it so i was walking in the store like a freak. THIs one guy at the shoe section was looking at me wierd and so i was like "freak" and also this senior from my school was looking at me funny too so i was staring at him funny back. After shopping at Sears, my mom and I went to my uncle's house and i had to use the restroom and when i was there i saw a tag sticking out of my shirt and i was like "OMG!!!" and then i asked my cousins and my sisters why they didn't tell me that i was wearing my shirt inside out! all of them said they didn't notice but one said that they notice but they thought it was a style! WHAT THE HECK~!!   okay well that's all.
