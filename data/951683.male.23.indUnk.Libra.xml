We had a really good time it was good to of course see Jenna, as much as I hate saying that! Grr!!    We had a really nice meal in the West End, as Mr Dad and Anna joined us also to see Jenna, and after that we headed around to the Trocodero to play bowling, where I of course won! Ok Ok I lost, and badly! Then it was off back to my sisters, to errm get drunk.... very drunk!    Anyhoo heres a few sightseeing pics that Miss Snappy Jo took

      You may or may not seen in the news about an American who was bloody beheaded live on a arabic website, ok these ppl say that the beheading of Nick Berg was in retaltion for the ill-treatment of the prisoners at Abu Ghraib.  Seriously, these ppl must be taking the piss, ok I wouldnt wanna be pissed on or anything, but to cut somebodies head off. COME ON!!! and to still think there has been more outrage over these apparent "real" pictures of brit soliders abusing prisoners than the beheading of Nick Berg.  The world is mad, just mad.  My matey today actually sent me the entire video, becasue to an extent ya just cant believe these ppl can do such things, which you can find  urlLink  here  please be warned though this is very graphic. So do not watch unless you are very sure.   Very scary times we live in, isnt it.

      awww i saw mr dad for the first time in a couple of weeks   he came to pick up his usual collection of enterprise episodes.  Its a shame I dont see mr dad more often, but then thats life.  He also mentioned that jenna really misses me. Mr Ben also really misses Jenna, but we shall keep that between ourselves shall we as she will get a big head or summat!

      People at work over the last week havent really been nice to miss becky, mainly becasue of stuff she did or didnt do on saturday night. So tonight I decided to tell her what they were saying, perhaps wrong of me I know, but I thought she really needed to know what they were saying about her. Becky hasnt had an easy couple of weeks and kinda got really upset   I just wish I could have been there to give her a serious hug.
