      Lost the feeling..  Never to remember the past..  Waiting for the 'new' day to come..  Remember the bad and good..  To cry or not to..  Promises are meant to be broken..  Most important thing in our life is to be happy..  No matter what happened..  Must always be happy..  And smile..  That people will follow you and smile..  To see the smile that open our heart..  And forget everything..

       Oh well.. I'm typing about my homework which that SUCKY Mr Low asked us to do last Friday then till now, I haven't do.. Haha..! Okok~! I will type it down then copy to my exercise book!  My favourite food is curry aka laksa. Curry is the type that got soup (orange colour), hot (chill) and many foods. I like curry because I like to eat hot foods. When I was young, my mum cooked curry almost every the Saturday. And when I  'm sleeping while she is cooking, I would quick woke up, forgot about sleeping more, brush my teeth and see her cooking curry. Or went to market with her to buy vegetables, potato, chickens, coconut and something else that need for curry..! I remember when I was young, I helped to peel the vegetables for mum to cook curry..! =P  My mum cook the curry is the  BEST  and  DELICIOUS ! Her curry is the most  DELICIOUS  and  WONDERFUL  I've even taste in my life. =P The curry ingredients have.. Coconut, vegetables, chickens, potato, water, tofu and the chill something. Plus! The rice noodles (My favourite noodles)! =P  I eat curry at home..! I would eat for three to five bowls a day! Haha! My mum always cooks the curry on the  BIG  pot! That her, me, sister and brother can finish the  BIG  pot a day or the left over will save on tomorrow.  I don't think that all my friends had even taste my mum's curry before. Because.. she cook are for me, brother, sister and herself and not for friends or other people! So i feel sorry~ =)  ~The End~ Thanks For SUCKY Mr Low
