						   Okie, Today Tuesday, 2nd week and 2 day of school... I bet today's blog will definatly be a short one... coz, nothing much to write abt...hahahaa.....  Hmm.. Today SUPER boring tutorials and lectures.. Espcially e Maths one, OH MY GOD!!!!! Now then i really glad that when i was in Sec4 i didnt take A-maths, but, that's also why today during the 1 hr lecture... i think i only can understand 1/4 of it?!.. Oh god.. pls bless me in my ICA!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Hahahahhaha........ Anyway, me not a Christian...so...hehehee...So, say for fun.. (NO offence........)  Then what... Let me think, yeah, today during IT1505 tutorial, i saw Krystal was drawing something on her handbook, so i was like asking frm her... Her handbook was full of little stories of the day, whereby she wrote down.. I "saw" her days in CJC, with her friends... When she really got so relunctant to leave CJC coz of her friends there... then saw her throwing temper to her guy....etc...hahaha.... Krystal seems to be a very moody girl.. Actually seriously, i really think that she still misses her friends n clicks in her CJC, although she always say that she dont really like the life in there.. Somehow i can sense that she's quite lonely here... in NYP... Frankly speaking, sometimes not that our classmates unfriendly, but sometimes just really cant "click-away" kind of thing... Maybe that's what they always say : Fated to be Friends..... If not fated, then how? Cannot be leaving Krystal behind right? Just hope that she'll be as cheerful as before, when she's in CJC? :

						   Eh... Y must i write everyday ar?.. Hahaha, even my personal diary also never everyday write lehz!! Hahahaa... Let's see... Maybe that's because i online everyday.. that's y...  Hmm..... Well, today, monday... Starting of week 2.. How's lectures? Tutorials? Everything's was pretty okie.. Just that during e 3 hrs break in-between.. A whole bunch of us went outside school..intending to go Town, in the end change e location to a nearer one... J8. N know what, hahahha... me n XueShan was "trapped" bck in the train because SOMEONE said that we have " no backbone".. So both of us went bck to e train without realising that e door's closing...hahahha....   J8 really got nothing to walk about lo.... ( And dunno WHO suggested that?!?!?!) Hahhaha... No coffee bean, nothing..... ( Okie, gd... i lost okie?.. i know u going to say that, Mr Adrian Tan... hahahha...) Well, i think our class did a lamest thing, which was getting off the train... (So that time me n xueshan continued the train journey is correct okie?!) Anyway, then we went to take taxi bck to AMK, yeah...i think u guys who often read my blog also got it... Go AMK play pool lo....hahhaha, what else?!...   Well, when taking e taxi, i dunno y spilt into 4, 3, 2 kind of sequence lo... ( 4 people taking e 1st taxi, then 3, then 2.... And of coz............. *Haiz) Hahaha... Y i always kena one ar?...hahahha....Anyway... So me n Adrian were "outcast" by e crowd (Again..) Then when we stayed inside there for 1+ hrs?.. When we came out, it was raining quite heavily... So, some pple said is "fated to take taxi" ...hahhaa, this class always taxi de lehz?!... Hhahahhaa... N the journey is SPECIALLY very near one lo... Very FAR journey kind all rather take train................... Funny PEOPLE~~~~~....hahaahaha  So, This time is like 4, 4, 4 ( 4 per taxi)... Coz rainning mah...hahaha....

Then, what else? Hmm... tutorials finished at 5.50pm.. Then all the gals went home went home, went out went out, all disappeared quite fast...hahaha, then i sort of joined the guys for dinner? ( But i didnt touch any food...coz going bck home makan....) Hmm, while going home, yeah.. so, i'm being left with someone else... (xpected...always i kena..................)

						   Herm.. Seems like almost everyday i come online and write something here horz?.. Addicted to it?.. Not really, hahaha.... just that someone soooo good REMIND me to write something here..... Well, anyway, i really have nothing to do... So, just write abit here n there?  Rainning real soon... Sunday, not like usual sunday though.. Left all alone in this house.. Haha, both my papa n mama went to malaysia so suddenly.. Now is only 1.10pm? Usually this time is like.. The house is filled with cooking smells and televison sounds... Today, abit quiet.. ( Jus that the stupid neighbour upstairs on the karaoke sooooooo loud... But yet, the chinese songs are nice....hahaha....) Getting real dark, so later have to iron clothes.. wash dishes, vaccum floor...and see if any clothes to wash...  So, what else? Let me think... ... Yesterday afternoon had alot of fun going out.. Then, watch a movie... So lame, yet so funny... Hahaha.. Then, what else? Hahaha.... (Chiam liaoz.. i'm being so careful with my words now... all because of YOU!!!!!!) Eh.. hahhaa.. like that lar... okie, let me recap in some pt forms, let's see what kind of image formed in ur head, = my whole afternoon event on Saturaday... --

						   Yup, now is abt 11.52am.. Haha..Going to be noon soon... Well, what should i say now?...  Yesterday, which was friday.. Hmm, attended e most lab classes of e week!.. Very boring though... Then after everything is about 2++pm? So while e other girls gone home.. I found 1 of my female classmates, XINYI, who has "passion" about Kendo..haha, then she agreed to go Kendo Trainning session in e evening at about 6+pm with me!.. Hahah, then, we didnt go home... Just join e guys to AMK there.. N these guys arh... REally nothing to say, our school NYP is located sooooooo near to AMK, then only across e juntion, yet they still took TAXI?!?!?... Hahah...to them, taking taxi is much cheaper.. From our 03 classchairman, Mr Adrian Tan's theory.. If go AMK by MRT, each person will have to pay 63cents of fare.. Then if 4 person take a taxi.. is only across e junction.. Then e meter is $2.40, so each person pays only 60cents.. 3cents lesser!!.. (WEll,...IS LAME!!!!) Nvertheless we took e taxi lar...coz 2gether have 8 of us?.. 6 guys 2 gals..haha..  When reached, there...of course all e guys went to play pool lo.. Then me n xinyi sat at e side of e table chit chatting... For sometimes, i think should let xinyi try abit, coz she never touch those cues before... So i suggest to let xinyi play lo.. In e end..i kena..hahah.. Which only left me n my dear classchairman playing e pool..SUDDENLY ar..Dunno y, ALL of them went missing like that lehz... ALL hidden at a corner laughing.. LIEW~~~~ Come on lar class03, dont suddenly do this kind of stunt to me lehz..... Should know something about me right?... " i shy ar..."...hahhaha... Sounds farmiliar?.. I said this sentance frm the start of school already okie?!?!?!?!.... Hahaha... Anyway, then in e end finally i got xinyi to play e pool herself..with 3 guys teaching her.. (She's much more fortunate..at least whole lot of us never went missing in action..haha..)   Quite fun actually...then me n xinyi laze around until 5.30pm like that.. we went off to e NYP by walking...N is like.. VERY VERY VERY near lo........... -_-|||  Waa...Nver know that e School Sports Hall sooooooo far... is right frm one end to e other!.. Hahah..then went there, outside e sports hall, must take off our shoes n socks, bowed, then 1st step in is left foot... (e procedures whereby every kendo memebers must follow) Overall, we did some warming up...some basic steps.. then sweating all over, with our jeans n pants...............-_-||| Anyway, is like quite interesting.. we also watched e seniors playing with everything on their body (looks heavy n thick!!.. ) together with their "Shinei", i think is e bamboo sword...yeah.. E way they play is like...."waaa.....beat soo hard on e head...haha...skali later faint ar..." But quite okie lar....much more fun then wat i thought.. is like e basic training like i had during sec 1 in Gal guides...when i have to learn e footdrills command all that... Everything ended at around 9+pm... Then is like i haven EAT!!....haha... Went to nearby Mac at my house there n bought something to makan.....  After my bathing...everything, seems soooo tired...haha, then my dear dear gd buddy called... Yes is you... is you.... IBNU FIRDAUS..( did i spell e name correct?..hahahaha..) This fellow, my gd buddy during seconday school life... Always got sooooooooo jealous about little things lehz...hahahha... Now know why he called yesternite? Coz he saw SOMEONE's name keep on appearing in my blogspot.. N his name only mentioned once lo............... Hahah...then started e crap like "yeah lar, 4get this 4 yrs friend liao lar........ blah blah blah..........." Hhahahhahahaa.... so i say, Adrian, u dead man..next time he sees you might use e "shinei" n wack u.... Hahhahahha... Nah.. just kidding.... Ibnu is a nice guy... Mr NICE okie?... hahahaha... so i dun think he'll resort to violence... (OR..... he CANT resort to violence???....hahhahahhaha... ;X) Okie lar... last time, let you, my friend... happy abit okie?..
