He was having trouble with getting a break, as would any half man /  half beast, but he persevered. His plans were to eventually break into acting and move to Hollywood.  Soon after his basket weaving failed, Ferla began seeing visions of his deceased mother. In large grassy fields he would imagine her image there, and he would often call out to her,

Ferla cursed his mom and decided to take some classes at the local community college for a degree in...

      the centaur life was not for him. Half man, half beast.... that wasn't what Ferla felt inside! Inside he felt like the two halves should each be their own whole. So one night, Ferla decided to sneak into Mom's prison cell and ask for her permission and money for a Centaur-change operation. When Mom heard the news, she responded by saying,

Later, the Flickas received word that Mom hadn't been hurt at all, but had talked many of the opposing centaurs to death. Mom's voice had a way of carrying in the wind, and the voice was like a poison to the centaurs. Ferla, of course, was feeling quite...

The Dr. said that Ferla was suffering from methamphetamine addiction and brain cancer, and would need to be operated on immediately. Ferla had no logical choice but to sign the waivers and allow the surgery.  When Ferla awoke from the surgery, he felt different than he'd ever felt before. He opened his eyes and looked at his body and screamed! He saw...

This wasn't a long list, since he pretty much kept to himself, but it did give him a reputation for being hard core. This new reputation got him into a new group of friends, called The Punk Rockers. This group was intent on listening to hard music and wearing mohawks. Ferla wanted to fit in with these Punk Rockers, so he grew a mohawk as well.  One day, the leader of the Punk Rockers group said to Ferla, "

As Ferla's teeth bit into the strange new dish, his entire body began feeling electric (boogie woogie woogie). He kept eating.  When the eel had been fully consumed, Ferla felt strangely alive for the first time. He kept walking north. He noticed that as his hooves touched the ground there was a strange shock, much like an electric shock. When Ferla pointed his hoof at a tree, a shock went from Ferla's hoof to the tree!  In a moment of self-realization, Ferla yelled out, "Oh, mama mia, I am...

      If something is coming to an end, don't try to prolong its demise. There is real opportunity coming your way, but you'll need to trust the process of letting go in order to make the most of this time. You may feel a bit scattered, for there could be several paths opening up to you. Whichever path it is that you choose, don't waste your energy thinking about the roads not taken. Make up your mind and put all you have into what is ahead.

      So I went to Border's last night and bought two books... David Sedaris' "Me Talk Pretty One Day" just came out in paperback, and I snatched that up. And I got "Best American Poetry of 2003". I get this and "Best American Short Stories of ____" each year... and I'm never disappointed.  But you know what they say -- never say never. I read the poetry last night and was apalled. Not at the poetry, but at my sheer lack of patience to read an entire poem. It's getting that bad, folks. I tried, but the poems seemed to really suck rocks. I couldn't get into them, almost none of them were about love lost, lover scorned, love unrequited.... and that's the kind of poetry I like. So sca-roo 2003's American Poetry, that's what I say!

      Dear Mom and Dad, &nbsp; OK, mom and dad, I finally found a man I can write home about. &nbsp; We met on the beach last year when I was doing my studies for the underwater basket weaving. You know what they say -- when you stop looking you finally find someone! Well, I did! He's great -- he's smart and he's funny and he's got a real keen eye for fashion. &nbsp; I can't wait for him to move to the states from wherever-the-hell-he's-from, so we can start a family and a real life together. Mom, Dad, I think he could be the one! I really think this is the love I've been waiting for! &nbsp; Oh, oh, I almost forgot -- I took a picture of him before I left. I've posted it below. &nbsp; Love you!, --Molly &nbsp; &nbsp;

      So my dad called me last night and said he was working on his crossword puzzle -- "What's a four letter name of a Salinger character beginning with E?" I was embarrassed -- couldn't think of it -- so I started digging through my books. Obviously it had to be in Nine Stories. Couldn't find the books, but I found "Winesburg, OH" which I had bought at the Tucson Library Sale for 75 cents.   Turns out the answer was Esme (stupid! stupid! stupid!), but I'm going to start Winesburg, OH tonight, for the second time.
