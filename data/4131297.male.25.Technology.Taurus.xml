      Ho .. This is one of my favourite song and its composed not by me, but Britney. Some feeling,    "Never look back," we said How was I to know I´d miss you so? Loneliness up ahead Emtiness behind Where do I go?   And you didn´t hear All my joy through my tears All my hopes through my fears Did you know? Still I miss you somehow   From the bottom of my broken heart There´s just a thing or two I´d like you to know You were my first love, You were my true love From the first kisses to the very last rose From the bottom of my broken heart Even though time may find me somebody new You were my real love, I never knew love ´Til there was you From the bottom of my broken heart   "Baby," I said, "Please stay Give our love a chance for one more day" We could have worked things out Taking time is what love´s all about   But you put a dart Through my dreams Through my heart And I´m back where I started again Never thought it would end   From the bottom of my broken heart There´s just a thing or two I´d like you to know You were my first love, You were my true love From the first kisses to the very last rose From the bottom of my broken heart Even though time may find me somebody new You were my real love, I never knew love ´Til there was you From the bottom of my broken heart   You promised youself But to somebody else And you made it so perfectly clear Still I wish you were here   From the bottom of my broken heart There´s just a thing or two I´d like you to know You were my first love, You were my true love From the first kisses to the very last rose From the bottom of my broken heart Even though time may find me somebody new You were my real love, I never knew love ´Til there was you From the bottom of my broken heart   " Never look back" we said How was I to know I´d miss you so?   Bye bye...     Katch you suun with new stuf, later.
