         My best friend (Gina) starts blogging since Feb this year thanks to her friend James (whom she knew online for the past 6-7 years) who gave her a blog as her birthday gift. Recently, my brother decided to create his own blog....hmmmmm...is blogging the ' in ' thing in cyberworld??? Or simply I've been ignorant with the latest technology updates?       Nevertheless, I don't want to feel 'left-out' and thus my journey of endless blogging begins. Once I started I can't seems to stop (esp when I'm darn free, read: my dept is overstaff), it's like being addicted to neslo. As a 'new born' blogger, I don't want to appear showy or exaggerating in my first post and yet at the same time I want it to be mild and subtle for easy reading.  Let's stop here and there's more to come   (",)  . Here's why I blog: -  · kiasu (don't wanna feel left out; everybody is blogging so why not me??); · my brain cell had ‘slept’ for a real long time and it’s about time it wakes up; · the desire to share my thoughts, life experience, juicy stories, gossips (another fave past-time) etc. etc. with my friends and family; · I'm single and have plenty of leisure time...sounds like I’ve nothing else better to do; · Uhhh...to improve on my English vocabulary; · what's the use of blogspot if you don't blog, I'm a person who utilise resources..
