       1. How to search in the channel   a) Typing !list  nick  in movies and/or music channel will show the file server ad of the nickname if he/she is serving. For example, typing "!list hero_i_am" (w/o the quotes, of course) displays hero_i_am's server in the channel you used the command in.   b) You can use ctrl+F to quickly find any txt in the channel window. Say you want to know see hero_i_am's server ad, do a !list, wait for all the ads to roll by, press ctrl+F, type in hero, press enter. You will be taken to the immediate last occurence of the word 'hero' in the channel window, pressing enter again takes you further up in the channel where that word appears.   c) Use @find command.   Syntax: @find keyword Example: @find murari   Note that @find fetches the results from only those file servers that supports it.    2.  Do not rename or move file(s) until you get them in full. You can always resume a file so the download will not start all over again.    3.  Keep checking the status window. That shows you whats happening whenever you request the download of a file, whether a download has been completed, whether your nick has been successfully registered and identified etc., i.e., whenever any mIRC command is executed    4.  To get some basic info on a user, use the command /whois nick. Example: /whois trigger_my_passion    5.  Pressing f3 function key will open your last downloaded file (w/ the program it's associated w/).    6.  If you are looking for channels on a specific subject, say 'hindi', you can use /list hindi and that will list the channels which have the word 'hindi' in their names. A popular hindi channel in irc.ircsuper.net is #desi-movies (#desi-mp3 for music). Other hindi channels: #apna-movies, #apna-rhythm in irc.unknownz.net; #bollywood in efnet (irc.easynews.com).    7.  By default, mIRC doesn't allow the auto-sends (and auto-gets) of .exe and .zip files. To get around it, type /dccallow +NickOfThePersonYouWantToGetTheFileFrom.    8.  Want to explore the world of IRC?  urlLink http://www.mirc.com/faq.html ,  urlLink http://www.newircusers.com/java/mirc.html  are just two of the n number of sites you can go to. Chk  urlLink ircspy  and  urlLink searchirc.com  too.

      Explains clearly the software you need and how-tos of playing, burning, editing and format conversion of movie files that you've downloaded from the channel.    Essential software

      First note the following:    1.  Do not serve tamil/hindi/english/konkani/african movies/mp3s/video songs. If you want to serve, serve  only telugu  files.    2.  Do not think about serving until you have  two complete movies in .mpg  format to share.    3.  Never ever serve partial files. To avoid sharing files that you are still getting or would be getting, keep the root folder (serving directory) different from your download folder.    4.  Do not serve unreleased movies. How do you know if a movie has been released or not? Join #telugu-help and ask there. By unreleased movie, we generally mean a DVD/VCD that you have and which you converted to mpg. So, the safest bet is to download movies from the channel, and when you got atleast two of them, begin serving.    5.  The only restriction w.r.t serving mp3s is that you are not to serve songs in .swf or recorded (from net streaming or casette) files.    6.  DO NOT serve mp3s in #telugu-movies. #telugu-music is the right place for that. Similarly, do not serve movies in #telugu-music.   You are encouraged to share your music collection apart from the movies you have. Sysreset has the ability to permit separate sends and queues for serving in multiple channels.    7.  DO NOT rename downloaded files. This will allow people to resume incomplete transfers.   The process   If you do not already have SysReset, download the full installation pack from  urlLink http://www.sysreset.com  and set it up as per the instructions in ' urlLink How To download ' page.  Follow these instructions:   1.  Go to Sysreset --

       1.  Register your nick.    Syntax : /nickserv register  mypassword   email    Example : /nickserv register sulekha yourmail@yahoo.com  [All mIRC commands preceed with a "/" and can be typed in any window. But you are advised to type in your status window].   2.  Identify to your registered nick.   Syntax : /nickserv identify  mypassword    Example : /nickserv identify sulekha   3.  Set mode +R to your nick so only registered members can chat with you.   Syntax : /mode  nick  +R   Example : /mode trigger_my_passion +R   4.  Unmask your host address.   Syntax : /mode  nick  -x   Example : /mode trigger_my_passion -x   5.  Have o?ne antivirus running.  urlLink Avast  is a good one and it's free.   6.  DO NOT accept/run any IRC channel cracking/hacking programs that promise to help u find passwords, speed-up your downloads etc. Mostly they are viruses or some kind of TROJAN. By using such programs you are not o?nly putting your machine at risk but also the channel and other users.    7.  DO NOT hesitate to ask the OPs or others for help if you are unsure of anything.    8.  Go through this website. We can't stress this more because we have seen people come up with questions that have been clearly explained o?n our website. If you need further assistance we'd be more than happy to help you. Please join #telugu-help and wait for assistance or message any active OP/server or knowledgeable user.   9.  Do not remain logged o?n to a file server if you don't have to. O?nce you are done using the Remote Window', close it.    10.  Do not ask for/speak about porn.

       1.   What are IRC, mIRC and SysReset?  IRC stands for Internet Relay Chat. It is one of the most popular and most interactive services on the Internet. More info  urlLink here .  mIRC is a free IRC client for Windows. More info  urlLink here .   urlLink SysReset  is a script that uses mIRC client.   2.   Is this free? What's the catch?  Yes it is. There is no catch.   As to why we are doing this, won't you share your movies/mp3s if you have nothing to lose? Do keep in mind that there will be occasions when you have to wait for movie(s) in 'queue'. That means first-come-first-serve w.r.t downloading movies. You need to have lots of patience as it might take time to get the download started or for the download to be completed. A typical transfer of a full length telugu movie from a T1 connection to a cable connection will take 6 hrs. You do not need to be of course in front of computer all this while. Once the file has been kept in queue or the download has started, you can minimize IRC and carry on with your work.   3.   How do I get started w/ IRC and download movies/mp3s?  Check the  urlLink How To Download  page.   4.   I get this when I type a trigger of a file server in the channel: "Server Notice: This server is using an alternate server method, please make sure your DCC Server is active and set to port 59. /dccserver +sc on 59. This is a mIRC command." What do I do?  Do what it asks you to do. i.e.,    Type: /dccserver +sc on  59   ['59' is italicized because it can differ. Majority of file servers from whom you get such notices (upon typing their corresponding triggers) have it as '59']   Type the trigger of the file server again  The server window should open up. If it doesn't, heres how you can make it work:  a) Open port 59 in your firewall. Refer to steps 6, 10 and 19 of  urlLink How to download  page.  b) Type the trigger of the file server again   5.   Where can I download telugu mp3s from?  Latest and the most extensive collection of mp3s can be downloaded from #telugu-music channel in IRC. A fairly good collection of user contributed mp3s can be obtained from  urlLink coolgoose .   6.   I want to share my movies/mp3s with others in the channel. How do I do that?  Read and follow the  urlLink How to serve  page.   7. &nbsp;  What is a 'voice restricted server'? How do I access it?  You can enter a voice restricted server only if you have a voice. i.e., if you have the + sign to the left of your nickname.   How do you get voice? By setting up a file server in the channel (and thus sharing the files you have w/ others).  Read  urlLink How to serve  page for further reading.   8.   I want to edit (i.e., combine, split), convert, play movie files (.mpg, .avi etc.). How do I do these?  Follow the  urlLink guide on burning, video conversion & editing  .   9.   How can I change my password?  /nickserv set password  newpassword

       1.  Go to  urlLink sysreset's homepage  and download the latest Sysreset Full Installation pack. At the time of writing this, the direct link to the .exe is  urlLink here .   2.

Go to the installation folder and double click on mirc.exe.   4.  mIRC Options dailog box opens up. Enter full name, email address, nickname and an alternative. You can enter just anything for full name and email address fields. i.e., they can be fake also. Try to see that the nickname you enter is unique. There is no way to know if the nickname you type in is already taken until you actually join the channel. If it is, you can later change it. For now, enter a nickname which is how you'll be seen to others in the channel. Alternative is a alternative nickname that mIRC assigns you during netsplits. Just enter the same value as you entered in nickname field.    Note : If I don't mention to modify any options, it means you are to leave them at default. Change them only if you know what you are doing.    5.  Click on + to the left of Connect and click on Servers. Choose IrcSuper from the IRC Network drop down menu.

Expand DCC tree and click on Folders. The folder listed in the second column is your main download folder. It is where movies get downloaded to. If you want to modify that, click on that entry and then click on Edit. The second entry shows the default download folder for mp3s.    10.  This step applies only to those using a router and/or soft firewall. Click on Server, tick 'Enable DCC server'. Make sure 59 is in 'Listen on Port' field. Check all the remaining squares.   11.  Expand Display tree, clk Options, clk Tray... and tick 'Place mIRC in tray when minimized'. Press OK   12.  Expand Other, click Keys and tick 'Escape key minimizes windows'. Press OK  Press OK to accept the changes and dismiss the mIRC Options dialog.   13.  You may want to maximize the main mIRC window itself and the window that has 'Status: not connected........'. This later window is henceforth refered to as 'status window'. It always has  Status:  followed by the current status in its windows title.   14.  Clk on Window menu, Options.. and tick Tile under Auto. Press OK.   15.  SysReset (menu) --
