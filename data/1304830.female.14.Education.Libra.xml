      Robert lives by me, and Katie, thats not Mr Blobby, thats Sarah Brumskill!!! So young and yet soo wrong... I know they do look really alike, and BTW, i am not talking to that stinking ROBYN WALKER! if she is mentioned in a good way here, i will automatically delete it!!!  BTW Katie, i am gonna tell the Fangy that you have a MAJOR crush on Tony Blair, and Robyn has a MAJOR crush on President Bush!!!

      I do not love stinking Tony Blair!!! Kathryn loves Mr Blobby! He's a pig-haeded, googley eyed, weirdo! BTW Who's Robert?

      Hello, Kathryn.  I DO NOT LIKE THE A NAME!!!!!!!!! Hey, I didn't know Katie liked Tony Blair..... Who's Robert? Is he the boy who you were sending emails to in History when we were in the IT room doing our projects? Oh, by the way, I advise you to not tell Fangy about him, otherwise she'll put it in her Mush Diaries. Bye!  Donna

       The Dante's Inferno Test has sent you to  the First Level of Hell - Limbo!    Charon ushers you across the river Acheron, and you find yourself upon the brink of grief's abysmal valley. You are in Limbo, a place of sorrow without torment. You encounter a seven-walled castle, and within those walls you find rolling fresh meadows illuminated by the light of reason, whereabout many shades dwell. These are the virtuous pagans, the great philosophers and authors, unbaptised children, and others unfit to enter the kingdom of heaven. You share company with Caesar, Homer, Virgil, Socrates, and Aristotle. There is no punishment here, and the atmosphere is peaceful, yet sad. Here is how you matched up against all the levels:     Level    Score       urlLink Purgatory   (Repenting Believers)   Very Low       urlLink Level 1 - Limbo   (Virtuous Non-Believers)   Very High       urlLink Level 2   (Lustful)   Low       urlLink Level 3   (Gluttonous)   Low       urlLink Level 4   (Prodigal and Avaricious)   Very Low       urlLink Level 5   (Wrathful and Gloomy)   Low       urlLink Level 6 - The City of Dis   (Heretics)   Moderate       urlLink Level 7   (Violent)   Low       urlLink Level 8- the Malebolge   (Fraudulent, Malicious, Panderers)   High       urlLink Level 9 - Cocytus   (Treacherous)   Very Low      Take the  urlLink Dante's Divine Comedy Inferno Test

      Your soul is bound to the  White Rose : The Pure.   "I've been waiting in the dark for a long time, shining my beacon of hope through the shadow.  If you see me, don't you hide your eyes from me."   The White Rose is associated with purity, honor, and chastity.  It is governed by the goddess Artemis and its sign is The Cross, or Agape.  As a White Rose, you are a person of your word. You may have a strong moral code, but regardless of your virtue, you always stay true to yourself.  To you, love is the most pure of emotional forms and it's just a matter of waiting for it to bless you.  Some people may say you are too idealistic, but it's only because you don't want to mess things up.     urlLink What Rose Is Your Soul Bound To?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla

        Your soul is bound to the  Solitary Rose : The Alone.   "When I wake up alone, the shades are still drawn on the cold window pane so they cast their lines on my bed and lines on my face."   The Solitary Rose is associated with loneliness, melancholy, and patience.  It is governed by the goddess Merope and its sign is The Sword, or Unrequited Love.  As a Solitary Rose, you may be summed up as a hopeless romantic.  You desire love and have so much love to give, but thing just never seem to work out the way you want them to.  In life, you can be very optomistic, even when things are gray and nothing works out to your expectations.    urlLink   What Rose Is Your Soul Bound To?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla

      (Bad move, Mrs. Elessar. I'm in LotR geek mode now.) Well, in Moria, Pippin drops a stone down the well, which wakes up the Balrog. Pippin's also not too good on jumping over 7-foot gaps, so the Fellowship are slowed down by said endearingly incompetent hobbit. Balrog then proceeds to try to eat Gandalf.  Pippin's also partly responsible for the death of Boromir. Although that we can stand.

      you do realise elijah wood is about 4"6, don't you, katie? and his hair is too curly. and his nose is too normal. i mean, it has to have some sort of caracteristic to its shape, if you get me. and his eyes are way, way too blue. i've never seen his ears - they've always been hidden by that hair you love keeps covering it up. oh, well, as long as you're happy, katie. hey guess what happened after skool in the library! fengjia said that her favorite character in lotr is legolas (altho' she doesn't like orlando bloom, but she like 'orli's' hair?!?), and when i told someone in the library (sue wang), sue said she didn't know fengjia had a thing for gay men... fengjia nearly killed me!

       Robyn   My mind has done a Blank.  Who am I?  What was that saying again?  Apparantly, I did it wrong.  Drawn or Done?  Cast your votes now.  OOH Also vote on wether Kath should go on a double date with me and Neil.  Her date would of course be Adam.   Or Sam, depending on whether Sean is still married by the 14th Feb.  Who knows?    Kath:   Everyone just IGNORE Robyn! She's hyper... she doesn't mean what she says...  :) I'm your friend... you like me... don't vote!   Robyn   I DO KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING.  LOOK:-  Fungi is a type of mushroom.  She is also my friend. Rachel is the name of a very large Mole.  She is also my follower. Kati is an animal that purrrrrrs.  (She has the pointy ears to match!)   Kath:   Ok ok... how much sugar have you eaten?  Well, we're going now... ignore the wierdo (Robyn, not me) and don't do ANYTHING she says!  *Men in white coats appear 4 Robyn* Ride's here! C ya!

       From Robyn:-   I wanted to be Pippin or Gollum.  How they are alike is beyond me but they are both pretty cool.  No Kath, not "pretty" preety!  Is that all she thinks about?    Kath:   PRETTY!!!! HAHAHAHAHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!! You fancy GOLLUM AND PIPPIN!  HEHEHEHEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE! SADDO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!    BOB:   No.  Gollum is Pretty Evil, gross, inhuman ect....  In other words, Fangy's twin.  On the other hand, Pippin is kinda cute!  So is Billy Boyd but Kath doesn't think so.   So Adam doesn't look like Billy then.  More of an Aaragorn, I think.   Kath:   I think Pippin is kinda cute...  Adam is not Aaragorn! Adam is 18, aaragorn is old Adam is cute Aaragorn isnt Adam has short hair Aaragorn has girly hair   By the way... ITS NOT ADAM!!!

Katie talks about Frodo's "cute"  little  nose, ears, eyes and  other  body parts Donna and Kati are obsessed with old men with hairy faces Rachel is obsessed with Sam Fangs is obsessed with Legolas - so is my penpal (but she likes Draco Malfoy too... i think that says more about her than you tho fangs) Robyn is obsessed with Pippin, frodo, merry, sam, etc...
