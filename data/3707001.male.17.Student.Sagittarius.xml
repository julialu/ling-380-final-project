      Man this weekend sucked...  Thursday when i was supposed to play ball wit those ppl, half of them never showed -_- ... like come on, its not hard to come to ball, and if something came up u should at least have the decency to call or AT LEAST explain over msn... but no, i was let down.  Later on thursday i went to work :(.  The big boss didnt close - that was a plus.  But both of the ppl in my department suddenly felt sick at the same time and left... leaving me alone to face the whole store by myself.  For those of u who dont work in groceries, facing (also referred to flatenning) means that i walk through every aisle and fix all the products so that the aisle looks like a solid wall.  After that u gotta fix the front and back displays.  With a friend and at a leisurely pace, it takes about 40 mins during on a weeknight.  I did most of it in 45, then had to face the diary department.  Man, 1 hr of absolute boredom... not cool  Yesterday, I woke up early (as usual) and turned on the comp.  I never realised how fast time flies when ur playing sc (comp game)... During one of the games, i checked the time, it said 11ish in the morn.  So i played a game or 2 more, and i check the time after what seemed like a second later and it was 2!!!  I knew that i was supposed to get ready and stuff at about 5 to go to my grandma's, but i decided that instead of taking my shower i was gonna play some FFX (my 2nd fav game ever!!!).  After about half an hour of leading Tidus through the Isle of Besaid, i feel asleep :S.  When i woke up my mom was yelling at me to make sure i was ready to leave... this was at 5:30.  So i ran in the shower, did my stuff, got dressed, grabbed the essentials (wallet, cell, MD, gum, forgot my keys

      Yesterday, I FINALLY GOT MY GRAD RING!!! now i just need $500 to pay my parents back for it and im good.  Let's see, yesterday was fun.  After gettin my grad ring, i went wit my parents to see our future house. (we move in sept, i'll miss u paradice)  It's finally starting to look like a home, we have walls and that pink insulation thingy.  I saw my future room, looks kinda small but im sure it'll seem huge when i move in and i stop sharing a room wit my annoying little bro.  Im confident that i'll do more homework next year than this year just cuz i'll have a REAL study space now... this year i did all my homework on my bed

      Wow, I ACTUALLY have a blog acc... I seen all my azn friends having one and I was like: "oh, that must be fun..." so I tried it out ^.^  I'm still unsure y I made one... I mean, my life is quite simple: eat, sleep, play ball, some video games, work and go to school once in awhile.  And who cares enough to read MY blogs anyways? (if anyone actually does read this make a comment or something -.-)  Anyways, today was the official last day of my high school career.  It's kinda sad and all, but at least I spent it doing what I love: BASKETBALL.  I got to school at 10:30ish, played for about an hour before getting kicked out for lunch break... went to KFC to clog my arteries, and played ball for the rest of the day.  It's weird tho cuz after school, I was standing in the caf... and not wanting to leave.  I'm don't think im the sentimental type, but I was sad to see it go.  Mowat's been my 2nd home for 4 years, and now its time to move on...  During ball, i was quite surprised when one of my female friends starting lighting it up!!! We have a 2v2 challenge wit me and my friend against her and her friend... i admit i did underestimate her... but shes still not good enough to beat us :P!!! I guess it goes to show that guys should never underestimate girls in sports, even physical ones... well except full contact football... and baseball... girls got their own girly versions (flag football and hardball or something... :S)  I got my yearbook too!! (thx to everyone who signed it)  But I didn't get a SINGLE SHOUTOUT!!  I thought I musta impacted someone's life enough to put my initials... guess I was sadly mistaken... :(  My grad comment didn't get published either... but I wouldn't have shouted out anyone cuz there's too many ppl that mean sooo much to me that I knew that I would offend someone.  Well, even if I haven't changed any lives, I hope that my friends will realize that I will always be here for them when they need a friend...  For those of you who wished I had posted a grad comment, I think it mighta gone something like this: "Hey Mowat, It's been 4 gruesome years but we finally made it! But I never would of made it this far without all my friends and family who supported me the whole way.  Every friendly gesture, down to the most insignificant waves, will be remembered and cherished for the rest of my life.      "I'll take with me the memories to be my sunshine after the rain.  It's so hard to say goodbye to yesterday."      -Boyz II Men"  For the 4th nite in a row my parents have left me and my older brother to find our own dinner.  It wouldn't be so bad if we had some mac & cheese here or something... but there is NOTHING in our home. :( Last nite I started playing sc (starcraft) and forgot about dinner... guess im doing the same tonite T.T.....

      Yesterday (Wednesday) was... interesting.  Well, i started off with the usual: wake up, sc, food, shower.  Then i got dressed to go to church.  But then i remembered that we're painting so i changed to something that i wouldnt mind getting dirty, namely some old jeans and an old black Nike tee.  My brothers decided to go outside and play basketball while my parents and i went to see our new house b4 dropping me off at church. As we pulled up into the driveway, we saw that our future neighbours beat us to the incomplete, rubble-ridden driveway, so we parked on the soon-to-be curb.  The drywall i think its called is up, and the rooms really look like rooms now.  My room is slowly getting smaller, but it'll by MY room nevertheless, instead of "me and my brother's" room.  I checked out my lil bro's room, even smaller than mine.  My parent's room was quite large, larger than their current room i believe, and they got a walk-in closet and their own bathroom... HOW UNFAIR!!! lol... I left after like 5 mins cuz i was kinda getting tired of going there and my parents were filling our house wit cigarette smoke :( ... 15-20 mins later, my parents finally left and we made our way to church On the way there, i feel asleep for about the last 20 mins of the 30 min trip while listen to my MD.  lol, it was funny cuz i remember dreaming i was playing basketball.  I recall some1 shooting the ball, and the ball bouncing off the rim, off the board and back to me... so naturally, i put my arms down and swing them up to gain momentum as i jump up to grab the board... just my arm swinging wakes me up just in time to see my mom turn around i say, "ur tired eh?" lol, i felt like such a looooser... but i played it off like it was nothing to my mom. Finally, at 7 on the dot i got out of the van and wave to my parents as they drive off.  I went downstairs, past the Korean ppl, past the kindergarten room, and into the gym where i met the suprised expressions of ppl who aren't used to seeing me at church wednesday nites, esp 2 in a row...  anyways, after getting a quick painting tutorial from Aaron, i went to work wit Matt and those 2 sisters whose names i cant think of rite now (sorry)... after 30 mins of intense work, i went inside the future youth room to chill wit Matt, where we talked about nothing and played "can u guess that rock band?" a game that i couldnt win if my life depended on it.  After throwing around one of those dirty large circular scrubbing pads that u put on the bottom of a buffer like a frisbee, Martha came in to give us some exciting news: SHE'S GOING TO BRAZIL!!!!!!  Ok... now for the dark side of me... If i was truly the great friend that i thought i was, i woulda been happy that everything worked out.  Cuz u see, 2 days things were looking so bad that one quoted "it would take a miracle for everything to work out", shortly followed by "but everything is possible with God"... well she was right, everything is possible and sometimes it happens!!  Sadly, being the greedy, ungrateful, horrible friend that i am... at that exact instance where she broke the news... i did not feel joy.  It's hard to say what i did feel, i definetly felt sadness, as i will miss the person who i talk to the most over msn... but, the dominate feeling was... almost anger, i dunno at who, maybe at Martha for leaving me, but... maybe at God for making everything work out... I KNOW!! I know... its SOOO greedy of me!! Like one of my most cherished friends just got the opportuinty of a life time, and here i am wondering what im gonna do during the nite!! Martha, God, im so sorry, plz forgive me... Dont worry, shorlty after those feelings i realised how horribly wrong i was in thinking that, and i praised God for sorting things out... Well, to continue with the evening, finally one of the ppl who were actually working finally got me and Matt to go back into the gym to work, but the she left herself... :S.  Martha went home but we had Ada to help our cause.  In the gym, me and Matt were "supervisors" meaning we stood there and watched, while every1 else continued to paint... i most say, it was looking fresher, newer, better in the sense that the cracks and stuff were all gone.  The colour choice, not my personal favourites, but last time Pastor Aaron tried to let us choose the colours, well come see our old youth room and find out :P Before long, some1 gave me the prestigous job of "brush cleaner"... joy... lol, i think that i am quite possibly the WORST brush cleaner in the history of Forward... it just wouldnt get clean!!! Well they didnt give me much to work with, a moderaately large sink, running water and hands -_-... no scrubbing utensil, bad lighting, and most of all a secluded location.  Anyways, at 9:30 we were done, most of the ppl had left by then, just me, Pastor Aaron, Robbie, Matt, and Aaron's sis left.  Aaron's sis left shortly afterwards, leaving just us guys.  Unfortunately, the only reason we were all there was cuz my parents, who i said to pick me up at 9:30, hadn't arrived yet, at 9:45, Aaron reluctantly told me that he had to go, despite the fact that i wanted to go since we first finished.  Being the great guy he is, he didnt wanna leave me alone, so he stayed even tho it was jepordizing his prior plans.  But just as he said that, my familiar blue Toyota Previa pulled up and every1 left happily in a flurry of waves and handshakes... On the way home we stopped by at Blockbuster where i found a great deal: $10 for Shenmue II, a great game by the way.  It has a mix of adventure and story line, but the same fighting engine from the acclaimed Virtua Fighter series, a must buy at $10 dontchya think?  when we got home, i played till 12:30ish (late for me) and went to sleep.  Today was good.  I woke up, did the usual (sc/msn) and remembered that it was Victoria day (i think its called).  I didnt have any plans so it didnt make any difference, but one of my friends invited me to a bbq, something woulda loved to have gone to but had no reasonable source of transportation as my parents had left and i wasnt sure if the buses were running (ya, i dont drive, i dont even have my G1 T.T).  Instead, i made plans wit a friend to run some sc, which he owned me in, and then some ball.  My bro ruined our sc as he unintentionally caused me to dc (disconnecnt) every 2 minutes.  At about a little before 6, he came to my door and we went to the courts.  Shortly afterwards, my brother arrived and we ran some "pump".  Most ppl dont know what pump is, but its a variation of "american" where u can perform a "put back" or alley-oop the ball in the air to steal 3 points from the person who first missed.  For the basketball unfaithful, american is pretty much every-man-for-themselves where first to 21 wins.  In american, ther person wit the best shooting or 1 on 1 skill usually wins, but pump makes the game so much more intense cuz at any moment an opponenet can gain 6 pts on u from something as insignificant as a missed shot.  Well i didn't win a single game, we played about 5 times, the last one i got to game point but my friend who was at 18 won off a pump... -_-, good times tho. During our games, some brown (no offense to ppl with the stereotypical word) ppl arrived and played on another net... lol, it musta been a family affair cuz there were at least 20 of them.  We finally challenged them, and MURDERED them, i think the score was 7-1.  2nd game, more of the same, 11-? (not more than 5 i think).  Then those ppl went to the opposite court, and we sat around talking.  10 mins or so later, they called us to their new court and challenged us, so we owned them again 11-4.  Then they got a decent team together, the game was INTENSE... they were up 10-8, their posession.  Their main play maker missed a pull jumper at the elbow and my friend crashed the board.  Im not sure what order it happend but my friend, whos prolly has prolly the best 1on1 skills amongst my wide range of ball friends, hit a sweet pull-up at about 3 pt.  Then he and I ran the old-school pick and roll, which was working beautifully all day, and i made the open lay-up :D.  So now its 10-10, win by 2 (standard rules), and 2 open shots later we won!!! YAY!!! But WOW!! the game after that we got "ruined"!!! Well the final score wasn't so bad: 11-6, but that doesnt show how we played... we were getting out rebounded horribly!! They changed their weakest player for some1 wit good height, good ups (jumping ability) and a solid drive.  My man starting playing better D and they started double teaming me in the post, forcing me to kick out to my bro who suddenly started missing the shots that he usually "wets".  I missed a 2 foot shoot, the pressure got to me... guess im still just a noob/rookie to the game... Guess practice doesnt always make perfect, u need some in-game experience to go with it.  Guess I'll be at the courts a little more often...   PS.  In case this is the last post u read i wish u bon voyage, our hearts and prayers are with u, u will be greatly missed T.T... in comemeration of ur leaving, the countdown has alrdy started here and on my msn...  35 dayz till ur back in my arms......(symbolically speaking of course)... hehe

      Here's SOME of the lyrics from my current fav song: Hope - Twista ft. Cee-lo I'd like to dedicate this song to my #1 fan Martha... ALWAYS KEEP THE FAITH!!!   "And I Wish God never gave the men power  To be able to hurt the people inside the Twin Towers, And I (I wish)  Wish God woulda turned they hearts righteous,  When they started to take innocent lives and become snipers, But uh  We will never break, don't underestimate, we shall motivate,  And we gotta pray, all we got is faith.  Instead of thinking about who gonna die to day,  The Lord is gonna help you feel better, so you ain't gotta cry today.  Sit at the light so long,  And then we gotta move straight forward, cuz we fight so strong,  So when right go wrong,  Just say a little prayer, get ya money man, life go on!!!  Let's HOPE!  Wish the earth wasn't so apocalyptic,  I try to spread my message to the world the best way I can give it,  We can make it always so optimistic,  If you don't listen gotta live my life the best way I can live it,  I pray for justice when we go to court,  Wish it was all good so the country wouldn't have to go to war,  Why can't we kick it and just get em on,  And in the famous words of Mr. King 'Why can't we all just get along',  Or we can find a better way to shop and please, And I  Hope we find a better way to cop a keys, And I  Wish everybody would just stop and freeze,  And ask way are we fulfillin these downfalls and prophecies,  You can be wrong if it's you doubting,  With the faith of a mustard seed you can move mountains,  And only the heavenly father and ease the hurt,  Just let it go and keep prayin on your knees in church!!  And let's HOPE    [CHORUS] Cuz I'm hopeful, yes I am, hopeful for today,  Take this music and use it  Let it take you away,  And be hopeful (hopeful) and He'll make a way  I know it ain't easy but that's okay.  Let's be hopeful!"    Heres the shortened lyrics of my fav song to sing in the shower: I swear - All4One I'd like to dedicate this to that special girl who im APPARENTLY taking to her prom... :S (they say the chorus like 5 times, one at beginning, between the 2 verses and like 2 at the end so i put it once :D)   "I see the questions in your eyes I know what's waiting on your mind You can be sure i know my part 'cause i stand beside you through the years You'll only cry those happy tears and though i make mistakes i'll never break your heart  I'll give you every thing i can I'll build your dreams with these two hands We'll hang some memories on the wall And when (and when) just the two of us are there You won't have to ask if i still care 'cause as the time changes the page My love won't ever age at all  [Chorus] And i swear by the moon And the stars in the sky i'll be there I swear like the shadow that's by your side I'll be there for better or worse till death do us part I'll love you with every beat of my heart This i swear"   Wow, it's only be a week since i started this thing and im already falling behind!! Well, it's been a few days since u last heard from me, so heres what u missed:  Sunday Missed Church :( (its not my fault really)... Well, i woke up turned on the comp, played some sc... the rest is kinda fuzzy.  I also promised a very special girl that i'd take her to her prom as a last resort, and she said that i was her first and last resort... YEA RITE!!! i can picture the last part of it but the first... naw... Also, i spent a hectic nite sorting out my timetable, its not like high school where they do everything for u, u have to first decide what u wanna do in University, look at the requirements for that program, make sure u take all the prerequistes for the later courses, and sort out when u wanna take what... THEN after that u have to check the timetable to see when the different lectures and tutorials for each course is going on, and then pick the rite ones so that nothing conflicts... whew, it was WILD!! after an hour i got the fall session done, but the winter never seemed to work, i tried changing this lecture that practical... it didnt work!!! I thought i had to drop a course but then a divine ray of light enlightened me and it was all so clear ^.^  Monday: I woke up, played some sc, and decided to go wit a friend to Fairview Mall to run some MvC2 (Marvel vs. Capcom 2) the BEST FIGHTING GAME EVER!!! Wow, it seemed like the longest bus ride ever... what seemed like an eternity seemed to only take 50 mins... lol, i struggled when i got up to tell my friend who took the bus almost everyday to fairview to get off on front of the mall, only to find out that the 85 stops INSIDE the mall at Don Mills Station, hahaha, every1 was looking at me funny, now i know why... Well when we got there, we seen some nice sales going on at Champs, Athletes World and Foot Locker, everything 70% off!!! If i had money i woulda bought something, but i didnt.  LOL, im $500+ in debt rite now, dont worry why :P!  Anyways, we finally reached the arcade at the other end of the mall and seen the the competition was already there.  When we walked in, there was a lil kid who was using some cheap characters which are looked down upon in the arcades, and an azn guy using reg characters.  After the azn won, i put in my money and died in like 30 secs!! LOL, i even accidently picked a cheap character and still got owned!! Well, after me the guy got to i think 9 wins total before my friend finally beat him and left.  Then i put my money in and owned my friend a few times, after we realised that the side my friend won on is kinda broken... the low block (which is key) wasnt working too well.  Anyways, i beat the lil kid and my friend a few times, then i gave my friend $.50 and let him beat me cuz i wanted to see him do something which he never did

      Today... was actually a good day!!!  I mean, despite the drama thats been going on the last little bit... today was good.  Earlier i posted when i woke up.  As i said then, i had to go to the dentist to get a filling.  I really hate going there, but today it wasnt so bad.  Through my mom, word got around that i was attending UofT Scarborough in the fall.  Well my dentist attended UofT as well, and he had some tips for me (nothing im gonna talk about, i need the edge :P)  After that pep talk, he left me to attend to other ppl.  I had been tired all morning, and the "Business Weekly" that was on the TV wasnt helping me.  I was just about to doze off when he returned and gave me the filling between questions and comments about university.  The whole thing took 5 mins, but i was the 30 min wait before that killed it.  Finally, my mother (who also got a filling) and I left the building and stood outside for our ride.  10 mins later we were on our way to our new house.  There, my brother and my mom went for a look inside while my stepfather and I stayed in the van.  It was quite silent in the van, not that any of us minded tho, he was reading something and i was listening to music.  15 mins later we got home.  After eating some leftovers, my parents and my older bro left my younger bro and I at home.  After starting up my msn and media player, i started messing around wit my blog template.  I didnt get too far, i widened the body part, thats about it.  Then i decided that i needed to clear my mind of what had been bothering for a while, so i went outside to run some ball.  Upon arrival, i noticed that there was not a single person at the courts or the adjacent park.  Nice... some silence is always welcome.  There i worked on my game a bit... mostly pull-ups and left-handed layups.  My jumper is coming along little by little.  I discovered some things that i didnt notice before.  Well before i get into that... heres the ideal pull-up:  Perform a cross over move of some sort, throwing ur defender off balance.  Shortly after making ur move stop on the spot, but as u do this, make sure that ur feet are lined up to the net, right foot (if ur right handed) slighltly on front of ur left, shoulder with apart.  Take a moment to collect urself and align ur shoulders to the net, then elevate straight up.  As u go up, bring the ball in ur right hand on front of ur face, slighlty to ur right, locking in ur right elbow to ur side while using ur left hand to support the ball.  On ur way up or at the peak of ur jump, release the ball, not pushing it, but stroke the ball towards the net in.  Ensure that ur shot has sufficient ark and rotation, improving ur chances of getting it in or getting a "shooter's" bounce.  To help make sure that u followed through cleanly, as u land ur hand should be above ur head, slightly tilted forward.  Now the only thing left to do is to listen to the swish of the net and the "oohs" and "ahhs" of the spectators.  That being said, i noticed some things about my shot.  Firstly, i was holding the ball too far to the right.  My elbow was somewhat locked in, but it was angled out to far.  This caused my shot not to look straight, tho it usually went in.  Not a big problem... but could result in inconsistency if i didnt hold the ball far enough to the right.  That was easy to fix. Secondly, i didnt always align my feet.  After u do a cross over, its not uncommon for ur feet to be pointing away from the net.  Well when i crossed to my left, my feet would point left.  This resulted in many bricks and air balls... not cool. Finally, i was not releasing at the peak of my jump.  When i started my ball career, i was a set shooter.  This meant that i would release the ball as i jumped, giving me more power but making it easier to block me.  I gradually developed my jumper, and have been happier ever since.  Well as i did my jumpers, i noticed that i was releasing the ball on my way up.  But i wouldnt release it at the same time every time, making my shots inconsistent.  So i started releasing the ball at the very peak, and they went in more often.  But more importantly, i didnt have to think about how much power to put, it just seemed to flow.  Well as i practiced, 3 girls started shooting on the other net.  I didnt get a good luck at them (mostly cuz my i didnt have my glasses), but they seemed really young, prolly 12-13.  So i continued to shoot around, not paying them any attention.  After an hour or so, i ran to the fountain.  I have mentioned this fountain before, but that fountain is soooo great!!! (excuse my lack of vocab)  Like, after u work up a sweat from playing all day in under the sweltering sun, nothing feels better than cooling off in the fountain.  I think i go to the courts for the ball, but stay for the fountain.  Anyways, if u ever come to visit me, the first thing i'd take u to see is the fountain.  Then i'd make u run through it with me... like lil kids.  Good thing i bring a ball to the court, otherwise those parents would look at me funny...  Well, after awhile, one of my friends from school, his bro and his cuz came and started shooting around on dif nets.  Moments later, another guy i played wit b4 came to run some ball.  We ran 2v2, me and my the 2nd guy vs my friend from school and his bro.  I started the game off weak, lost the ball, missed a few hook shots, threw some bad passes.  Before i knew it we were down 6-4.  So i stepped it up, my friend from school whos smaller than me was guarding me, so i just posted him of, drop stepped to my left and made the smooth baby hook.  After my teammate made a few baskets, i made another hook and we had game point.  At the top, they checked the ball to my teammate, he passed me the ball and i faced my man up.  As i looked around, my teammate set me a screen to my right, so i ran around it.  The guy who was defending my teammate didnt step out, so i had the open shot.  Then i set my feet, aligned my shoulders, elevated and released the shot at the peak in one smooth motion.  As soon as i shot it, i knew it was cash... so i watched as the ball floated into the net (not touching the rim), bounce off the net and roll slowly to our feet.  Another victory for Warren... tho i wasnt all that proud.  My friend from school had bad coordination, and wasnt nearly as skilled or experienced as i was (no offense).   His bro was alrite, i'd say just as good as my teammate, maybe a little better.  After running throught the fountain twice and going home to get some water, i came back to another game.  3 ppl had come, one very tall one and 2 brothers.  We started a 4v4, and i was assigned the tall guy -_-.  He was about 6'4, 200 lbs, and muscular build... kinda intimidating.  He was the most talented of the 3 ppl who came, he was slightly quicker than me, but the height advantage was the real killer.  Luckily, he was also not too quick, something i took advantage of.  Time for Warren's shooting zone...  Well, finally the game started.  I started off slow again, i missed a few layups... theres no excuse for it but that tall guy kept on intimidating me, making me afraid of getting blocked.  Then the other team was up about 8-6, and i decided to step it up.  I started running around more, giving up on playing big and concentrating on getting open.  My man underestimated my shot, so i set up on the outside waiting for the pass.  When the ball touched my hands, my mind went completely blank, it was just me and the rim, nobody else was there, no pressure.  So i took it like i did during my shoot around, releasing the ball at the peak.  I took joy when it released my hand, it felt right as soon it took flight, i knew it was money.  The next play, i set a backdoor screen for one of my teammates.  The oppenent didnt see it coming, and he got completely stopped in is tracks.  As my teammate ran around to the other side of the court, his man tried to catch up.  Then i turned towards the top and found the ball at my hands.  There was a miscommunication and no1 picked me up.  "Just me and the rim" i thought again... swish.  10-10 .  As they checked the ball, i stood under the rim, comtemplating which side to run to.  When my teammate got the ball up top, another one ran towards me, so i ran around him, attempting to mix up our defenders.  At this time my team noticed i was hot, so they got me the ball.  I stood slightly to the right of the top of the imaginary arc, dribbling the ball casually while keeping my head up as to not miss any easy passes into layups.  Screen left, i ran around, my man got caught behind.  As i ran just inside the elbow, i stopped on a dime, set my feet, and hit a clutch pull-up-almost-fadeaway jumper... nothing but air (we dont have meshes

      Saturday morning... and i was up at 8!!! U havent missed much since my last post, but whatever did happen is a blur to me cuz of something else that is constantly on my mind.  Heres what i can piece together:  Thursday: I went to work at 3,  worked till 5 until my manager left, took a 45 min break on front of a camera

      It's been less than a day since i lost blogged.  I usually dont do write this often, but this morning was to much for me to hold in.  Everything was going just how i imagined it before this morning.  I felt as tho i was in complete control.  I was an ocean liner taking a cruize of the Caribbean... everythings going good.  How wrong i was.  What seemed like an ocean liner was really me drifting in my dinghy.  Small and fragile, where the smallest gust of wind could top me over.  Well today, i hit more than a gust of wind, i hit a storm.  I was just cruizing along, having a friendly convo.  This person wouldnt believe me about something i said, so i reinforced it with the best example i could use, not even considering the possibilites or the consequences.  Well the last thing that i could've expected to happen happened, creating a storm of emotions.  No details here, but i simply could not find the words to say.  Did i stop? No.... i asked another question, and got the only fitting answer to finish the convo.  At this point, it was too much, I had to leave, I had to run away... even if it was just for a moment. So i signed off and went upstairs throwing myself and other things around my room, trying desperately to cope... finally i just sat on my bed, back to the wall, and put my head down.  I was so lonely, i needed some1 around me, so i called up my friend and we went to MickeyDs. I called him up half way to his house, he lives on the way so it only makes sense i pick him up.  As i saw him, i put on a fake smile and acted like everything was ok.  I wanted to tell him everything, but i was happy enough just having some1 to talk to about anything.  When we got there, we were about to order breakfast, but while we were thinking they changed to their lunch/dinner stuff.  We were both to shy to order now, so we ended up just sitting in MickeyDs just chilling, talking to some1 else who works there.  LOL, one of the employees tried to sell us a coupon, it was good too, i woulda bought it if i had money.  Big Mac combo for $3!!! Anyways, we left, went to Mr. Sub next door to get some healthier food.  My friend ask for my recommendation, i said Louisiana Chicken.  We both got one, and i got an assorted for my mom (i knew she'd be mad if i didnt get her anything).  On the way back, i asked a simple question, something to help me out.  Sadly, he gave me the exact opposite of what i was thinking.  All that did was make me 2nd guess my morals and values.  On the other hand, the food was good.  Finally, i got home.  I wanted to talk to that friend, but he/she was gone.  It's funny, i ran away before, and all i wanted to do was talk to this person now.  O well, that email will have to do.  On the bright side, something tells me that it might not be as hard as i thought... if all goes well.  Yes, u cant tell through this very unspecific blog, but it was a storm.  Although it didnt seem like it at the time, going through the storm was all worth it... getting thrown around barely surviving in my dinghy was worth it, to see that beautiful sunset in the end...

      Again, you have come to this page hoping to read of some exciting happenenings, only to be disappointed... but here it is anyways:  Monday: nothing exciting, SC, msn, ShenmueII, CS (counterstrike)... too lazy for ball, too lazy to go to grandma's... nothing sticks out about monday, just another mediocre day in my mediocre life.  Tuesday: I woke up and read a heart-warming e-mail from a good friend.  I replied, then sc/msn to lunch.  Ate something, played CS, then took a shower and went to work.  Immediately after arriving at work 7 mins late

      Hmmm... havent missed much in my life, but here goes nothing:  Friday: Woke up, sc/msn, played some more ShenmueII... till before work.  LOL, i was late for work cuz i was gambling in the game... somethings will never change i guess. But i did find a certain win gambling booth, so i guess its not gambling if u cant lose... :S Anyways, went to work late, my department manager closed -_-, and it was just me him and some old guy i dont talk to working, man was it boring!! Ate chef boyardee beef ravoli for dinner, felt sick 15 mins later, worked it off by the end of the shift.  Got home, more of the same stuff, slept for work...  Saturday: Woke up at 8:40 to get rdy for work at 9!!

      Yes... you are reading correctly... I did sprain my ankle again.&nbsp; Well I'll start from the beginning of the day. &nbsp; I awoke to the&nbsp;beautiful yet familiar melodies&nbsp;of "End of the Road" - B2M.&nbsp; Usually I go downstairs to check whos online, but it was Saturday, so I decided to sleep in until I had to shower for work.&nbsp; At 9:30, I finally got up and dragged myself to the shower.&nbsp; 9:55 got outta the bathroom... hmm... late again I see... o well.&nbsp; Listened to some "Twork It Out" - Usher as I dressed.&nbsp; 10:10ish... punched in.&nbsp; After I put on my clip-on-tie and apron, I got the chance to catch up wit a guy I hadn't seen in 2 weeks.&nbsp; I told him whats been going on the last little bit, he said I was "pimpin it", I laughed and sternly told him "no".&nbsp; He told me that he's got a tough decision coming.&nbsp; He has the job interview which pays VERY well... but hes unsure if he wants to do this or go to UTSC for me... he said hes gonna pray at church when we go together tmr, but ima start today :) &nbsp; O ya, we're doing this thing where we go to different churches and see the differences... I shoulda started writing notes... o well, we've only gone to 2 so far:&nbsp;Forward and his old catholic church, but I hope we visit lots more!!&nbsp; For those of who dont know... catholic churches IMHO are so boring!!&nbsp; Like no offense but it was too much.&nbsp; I stayed awake the whole time cuz it was an evening service so it was shorter and cuz it was my first time.&nbsp; They are very ritualistic there, lotsa chants and stuff they expect u to memorize.&nbsp; Also, I never noticed how enthusiastic Pastor McNeil is, but the main priest I guess is sooo boring to watch.&nbsp; I'm sure he was praying or something... but I coulda sworn he was sleeping for pretty much the whole thing!!&nbsp; He didn't preach but my friend tells me that they are very boring when they do, while Pastor McNeil is very emotional and talks to YOU... I love my church.&nbsp; I wish I was there more often... lol, I say this but I'm breaking some1's heart (well not really) by not going to the picnic tmr.&nbsp; Then again some1 couldnt tell me how to get there, and I did sprain my ankle so I dont feel so bad... but still... sorry :(.&nbsp; I truly will miss you, esp if I dont see u again... &nbsp; Well back to my boring work day...&nbsp;after catching up wit my friend&nbsp;while filling the bread, we all topped off the grocery order, went on break (hehehe, extra long one), and buggies.&nbsp; Then he and I got split up, he did the dairy order and I did the pop

      What a waste of a perfectly good day off... **sigh** here's what i did yesterday:  Woke up, commented a blog, sc/msn i believe, lunch, sc, shower, phone/msn, went to buy stamps and mail letter, sc w/ a friend, solo sc, sc/msn the rest of the nite.  -_- ... what kinda day off is that??!!  My first idea was MvC2 at fariview... but my friend had no $$$.  Then I wanted to run some ball... crappy weather, looked like it was gonna rain at any second.  Got back on the comp, talked to some1, we almost made plans but due to indecisiveness or busyness on their part, it fell through.  So me and my friend wit no $$ ran some sc.    *** U sc illiterate prolly dont wanna read the next few paras*** *** Those who don't care also wanna skip the next part*** I hosted a 2v2 LT, since we had diff names ppl didn't know we where friends so it was ok.   Game 1: I'm Terran (as always), friend is zerg, gainst Z&P LOL... first game, a few mins in... I had just set up my wall (terran is my fav race) when 3 zlots and 6 lings broke through.  Of course my wall had to let the zlots through :\ ... Like come on!!! IT'S A WALL!!! ... anyways i lifted my buildings and ran to my friend's base.  I had 2 rax and a cc.  So i brought the cc safely to my friend's base and used the rax for scout.  WOW!!!  If I ever met one... my friend is an sc GOD!!!  These 2 ppl who rushed me... couldnt beat him!!!  Like how??!!  He had no expos when i died... and he still won!! LOL... i need to practice.  All he did was mass hydra... but still...  Game 2: T&PvZ&P My friend goes 2 gates outside main, I wall up and go tech.  My friend sends 1 zlot, then sets of 2 after... he kills all blues probes ^.^  But somehow, I am the downfall again.  After my supposed holeless wall goes up 6 lings appear... so I'm like "ok... my wall will hold" ... Suddenly they just run around the wall along the edge of the cliff -_- ... WHAT??!! I had 2 rines at the time... they died... Luckily, the lings didnt go straight for my mins so I had time to bunker up my main... a few struggling mins later...  I survive.  My friend had 1st expo, then Z oppenent then me.  LOL... P opponent had NOTHING!!! I suddenly didn't feel so bad.  Anyways, my friend makes 20 goons, i send 3 vults and Z gives up, we kill blue and another vic!!! ^.^... at least this time I survived on my own...  Game 3: T&PvZ&T Yes... we owned.  Z went hatch then pool, but really late... my friend had 2 zlots going in before red had pool out... Z practically dies before his T ally comes to the rescue.  I was already building faster then the other T... so I dropped... 2 gols and 1 tank right on his scvs... OWNED... HEY!!! I'm getting better ^.^  Game 4: TvP This was the best game by far.  We were both terran, they were both protoss.  We both wall... lol... his wall was so simple but mine is so struggle :\ ... anyways, 3 goons almost broke through but I finally got my tank out.  Then they tried my friend... are they dumb??!!  If they cant beat my wall then they cant beat his :P Anyways, I go expo... turrets on cliff... nice...  Then we start the push.  LOL... we had like 25 tanks all over the middle of the map wit mine and turret support.  We set up outside first toss base.  He can't break through.  We send vults up... no one home.  Then we sent some more tanks up his ramp and GG.  I had comsat and scanned the other toss expo... no obs??!!  Easy vic... I dropped 1 tank, 4 gols and 4 scvs... and I immediatley started turreting the cliff.  Due to cliff advantage and no obs, he couldnt see until I had 8 turrets up and after I seiged my tank.  He tried to shuttle drop and got scared off by the turrets.  Owned ^.^  ***********************************************************************  THAT was the highlite of my day :\ ... Not that I didn't enjoy myself, it's just that I wish I coulda made better use of my day off.  I can play sc anytime (tho not always wit my friend), so I wish I went out, or ran some ball (alone or wit my Mowat friends).  **sigh**  O well... I'm back to work today... ugh... not again.

      It turns out that I was sadly mistaken... I actually did not know the answer, nor will I know for a while.  So what I thought was the end was really the middle... possibly a very long middle... but one I'm happy is there.  But before I found this out, I decided that I wasn't about to let this get me down.  If I turned around and ran everytime conflict arises, what kinda person would I be?  Luckily, I did go on msn last night, and I did sort things out.  Right when the storm was kicking up again, the person who left me in the lake came back with a life saver, almost losing us both in the struggle.  Don't get me wrong.  I still am a ghost, I still go unnoticed.  I am still that drifter who hasn't found a place in life.  But now I do have a meaning, a purpose.  I again have something truly worth fighting for.  My goal in life?  To make something of myself so that when that day comes I will be ready.  Forever... I seem to be using that word alot lately.  But now I truly mean it, not that I didn't before.  It still feels as tho forever will happen.  But now I can wait for forever happily cuz I got something to look forward to:  another's happiness.  No matter what happens, just promise me that you will be happy...  To my friends: Last post I pretty much gave y'all the cold shoulder before u even talked to me.  Im sorry.  I can't say I was lying cuz I wasn't, at that moment I wanted to be alone.  And I was alone, maybe not as long as I expected, but I was.  My trust in myself, my faith in my abilites... is slowly returning.  It was lost when I started questioning myself, but that has stopped.  Why?  I'm not sure... cuz I reached a resolution I'm happy with I guess, and that has restored my faith in myself.  But when I say that I don't wanna talk to my friends, I mean that I don't wanna talk about IT... I'm always here to talk if u want to talk about something.  To my great friend: I truly do mean it when I call u a great friend.  You where there when I needed to vent... even offered yourself as a punching bag.  Tho it may not seem that way at the time, your insignificant actions can mean the world to someone.  And your's are no exception.  I truly thank you for being there.  To the source of my anger/frustration/confusion/depression/sadness/but-most-importantly-happiness (yes... 100xhappiness :D): I was not lying when I mentioned all those emotions.  Yesterday I felt the most extreme emotions ever: from anger to regret to depression... more depression... then relief and finally happiness.  But thx to you no matter what has happened I will from now on me a stronger person.  So I dedicate this song to you:  Good Man - RL   "You could catch me in the Gentlemen’s club Substitutin’ lap dances just for love, love, love goin’ home to an empty house Thinkin’ who should I call for some fun, hey   I never knew love until you, love Never thought that I’d fall in love Till you brought out of me The man I always knew I could be, baby    I can count the lovers that I’ve had                 [Hook]  And all of those relationships gone bad I wanna thank you for guiding me And showing me love I was just a boy and not a man Falling deep in love was not the plan Baby, because of you and what you do You made me a good man, oh, baby   Used to change my numbers every other week Gettin’ crazy crank calls from them freaks i'd meet  In V.I.P with a bottle of somethin’ Tryin’ hard to push on some heat  ‘Cause I-I never knew love until you, love You showed me a true love You gave me the chance Now I understand how to be a good man, oh, yes   I can count the lovers that I’ve had (I’ve had)      [Hook]  All of those relationships gone bad (Relationships) I wanna thank you for guiding me And showing me love (The love, yes) I was just a boy and not a man (Not a man, no) Falling deep in love was not the plan Baby, because of you (You, you, you) and what you do You made me a good man    Thank you for lovin’ me  (Where is the love that you promised to love and When was the love that we share, where is your love, oh, yeah)  But if it ain't you, my love’s for nobody  (Nobody, nobody, nobody, nobody) (Oh...oh...oh...oh...oh...)   I can count the lovers that I’ve had  (Baby, baby)   [Hook]  All of those relationships gone bad I wanna thank you for guiding me And showing me love I was just a boy and not a man Falling deep in love was not the plan Baby, because of you and what you do You made me a good man, oh, baby   It’s all because of you."

      Last nite i said, "I am now officially one step closer to happiness. Hmm... could it really come true???"  I now know that answer.  In case you cannot figure it out from the mood of this post... its... i dont even wanna say it.  I've lost the will to do what i used to.  I dont wanna write in this anymore, i dont wanna be on msn anymore, i dont even think playing ball can give me that momentary peace anymore.  I dont know whats gonna happen... to tell the truth i feel as tho it doesnt matter anymore.  I work today at 3... whats the point?  To make money... money cannot buy me happiness.  To keep busy... nothing will keep me busy enough to clear my mind.  I also dont know if ima be at the youth nite which mite not even happen.  I know i promised ppl that i would go, and i hate breaking promises.  But this may be one of those times that i do... I just... cant bear to face...  I was right.  I am a ghost.  I blend into backgrounds, going unnoticed.  I am meaningless.  I have no purpose.  I am a drifter, moving from place to place, school to school, existing solely for the purpose of being alive.  I have nothing to fight for.  Nothing to inspire me.  No goals... just going for the ride that i started.  Maybe one day i will fall out of this depression.  Maybe someone will lift me out of the lake of sorrow that i am drowning in.  But right now there is a storm overhead... and no one can lift me out.  So i will stay here... dragging myself through life only to make others who care happy.  Forever... is a very abused word.  Is anything forever?  I'm usually not one to say what i dont mean, and i've used it many times... but im doubting it myself.  Well... i was also speaking my mind.  It feels like forever is whats gonna happen.  But maybe im forcing forever.  For what?  Im not sure... to prove myself?... to avoid it happening again?  Or am i just a liar; someone who uses words when it suits them, not caring about the true meaning of what i say?  I dont know...  If you are one of the few who are still proud to call me a friend, dont try to console me now.  Usually thats what friends do, but i've done it before... and i dont want others to do it for me.  I dont wanna hear comforting words... cuz im gonna think its a lie.  As much as i trust you, i cant trust others when i cant trust myself.  And rite now i am the last person i trust.  So if ur reading this... i dont know what i expect you to do.  Nothing sounds good.  I'm not tryna say that i dont need friends.  Cuz there are many times that i have.  But right now is not one of those times.  Just leave me be... for now...

      The last few days have been a little more easy-going than the ones before.  Here's what u missed:  Sunday: I did nothing!!!  I missed church, sing&share, and 2 phone calls cuz i was on the comp playing sc or listening to music or playing xbox... could some1 plz buy me a life!!!   Well something meaningful did happen.  While i was laying in my bed, thinking about some1, that some1 called me as i was about to doze off.  I was momentarily startled when the phone rang, and i was confused when the caller display said "Caller ID Blocked".  I know of 2 ppl who when they call me it says that, and neither of them would call me at this time.  Well now i know 3!! :D  Anyways, being the worst person to talk to on the phone, after a smooth start i messed up the rest of the convo because of my introvertness.  Then i completely ruined it when i took to long to plug in my charger and let my phone die... ya im an idiot... the sad part is that i didnt get to say goodbye...  Today (Monday):  Woke up, msn, sc, lunch (leftover lasagna which was left on the counter over nite

      I used to be a poet back in the day... let's see if I still got it.   My Day   When I wake up in the morning, you are on my mind. When I wanna say something, the words I cannot find. What has changed? Why do I feel so strange? Why is love so unkind?  As I watch you leave, it makes my heart feel sad. But as soon as you return, once more my heart is glad. But while your gone, you're what my minds still on, So I reminisce of the times we had.  When I go to run some ball, you're still in my head. When some girl's watching me, I imagine it's you instead. So I try to score, to win your heart once more. Does more truly need to be said?  When I lay in my bed, I almost wish I never knew Of what you feel or felt, of ur feelings true. Yet I hope it doesnt die, so I close my eyes Hoping to dream of you.  [25]

      Another weekday morning, another morning for me to reflect on the nite past.&nbsp; Here's what I've been reflecting on:   Yesterday: Woke up 8ish, read an unexpected email.&nbsp; Kinda made me wish I got up when I first woke up.&nbsp; O well, that morning the thoughts of 2 nites past were still fresh so I posted.&nbsp; Then I played some WC3.&nbsp; I won twice! Woooot!!&nbsp; Afterwards I ate lunch and talked on msn I believe... I'm not sure.&nbsp; My memory of the time between lunch and work is kinda fuzzy, no offense to the ppl who filled it for me.   At 3:30ish I got in the shower to get ready for my 4-9 work shift.&nbsp; I had just listened to some of Without You - JE so I was feelin their music.&nbsp; As I showered I sang along wit someone in mind ;).&nbsp; I finally got out of the bathroom at 3:56...

      Today was interesting... here's what ya missed:  &nbsp;  I woke up at 7:20!!!&nbsp; I'm not sure why either, I guess it's cuz I went to sleep kinda early the night before.&nbsp; Or maybe my slightly sprained ankle had something to do with it.&nbsp; Anyways, 7:30ish, I was at my comp...&nbsp; I opened an email from a special somebody but didnt reply to it yet... I wanted to save it for later when I was fully awake and was missing her even more.&nbsp; O ya... 2:30 am send time...?&nbsp; Very disappointed...jks  &nbsp;  Hmm... Matt came online and we talked about tmr... I'm really looking forward to our date!!! I mean... uh... :$... hahaha, jks.&nbsp; 11... EB... I'll be there ;) (I hope I dont forget those games!)&nbsp; Hmm... some1 else came online and we spoke for a lil bit... then they both left me alone on msn.&nbsp; That's when I replied to that email, when I missed her the most knowing that I coulda spent an afternoon wit her

      It's looking kinda gloomy outside and I got 3 hrs to kill before I go to work... ugh... work... here's the update:  Monday: I worked from 12:30 to 9...&nbsp; ô.ô ... Ya, so it's just an 8.5 hr shift but still, I'm not used to doing this kinda work.&nbsp; And it was on a monday, so we just got the grocery order in.&nbsp; There were 3 of us men and 1 girl doing the load.&nbsp; I separate the girl cuz she works on cash but got grocery hrs cuz 3 ppl went on vacation, shes not as fast as us tho, not cuz shes a girl, but cuz shes not used to the work we do... and cuz shes a girl :P.&nbsp;&nbsp; Anyways, in total we musta gotten 6-7 skids... wooo... by the end of the nite they were all gone!!&nbsp; I worked my @$$ off... whenever I'm working and a manager is in I just can't help but work extra hard.&nbsp; I also cut my finger on a box... yes u heard me, a box.&nbsp; That box was deadly!&nbsp; It was a lil more rigid than most, and as I bent down to put it on the ground, I let it slip down my hands.&nbsp; As it went down, the corner sliced open my right index finger.&nbsp; It was a pretty big cut.&nbsp; 2 days later and it still hasn't healed yet.&nbsp; Last nite I was still able to open it and see the red of my flesh, but now its sealed itself quite nicely.&nbsp; Anyways, work was boring...  When I got home I went on msn where I learned alot more about myself.&nbsp; It's true, when I think or do things I tend to exaggerate the effects or seriousness of it.&nbsp; But I still see this as a long term decision.&nbsp; And I'm still sure that if she was wit u then u wouldn't ever hurt her enough to chase her away.&nbsp; You don't seem to understand, that if Plan B happens them Ima be happy, as in "I wont try to steal her away" happy... as long as u do as u promised.  Well... I'm 17... possibly not even finished 25% of my life.&nbsp; Sometimes I wonder, am I growing up too fast?&nbsp; Should I have done what I did?&nbsp; If I go to Plan B... well I truly be able to go through with it the rest of my life? ... I'm sure that if I was to do B then she'd want me to break that promise... but still, that'll just show more of my fickleness and tell her that she can't trust anything that I said before or anything that I will say in the future.&nbsp; And what would people who I meet in the future think when I tell them that the I broke my promise to that last person I cared for? ... But no, I still have no regrets...  Tuesday: My only day off this week ^.^ ... and it rained... hahaha, just my luck eh?&nbsp; Well I ran some SC and WC3 before I finally left to get my haircut.&nbsp; It feels so nice to lose all that extra hair and&nbsp;it's so much easier to keep in check now.&nbsp; I was considering doing the bald fade but heeded my mom's warning and decided not to.&nbsp; But honestly... is my head really too small for my body??  After the haircut we went to my Grandma's where my rentz are tiling part of their basement.&nbsp; It's look pretty good... then me, my mom, and her mom went to this cheap chinese buffet right at the corner of Brimely and Eglington called China Buffet... original huh?&nbsp; The food was good in comparison to the price, and after dinner we returned wit food for the ppl who got left behind.&nbsp; There my uncle and I ran some dreamcast.&nbsp; LOL, he beat me twice in MvC2!!!&nbsp; Not that there's any excuse, but I felt bad for running the expert tactics so I kinda took it easy on him, but he deserved those vics anyways.&nbsp; Afterwards we ran soccer, he won, then NBA 2K2.&nbsp; He won the first game by 20+ but I got the cheapest, flukest win ever the 2nd.&nbsp; It was the final minute and I was down about 8.&nbsp; Like in the NBA, my team started to intentionally foul.&nbsp; But my uncle put it on arcade mode so there were no calls.&nbsp; I took the cheap baskets and brought it within 2.&nbsp; Wit about 10secs left he inbounded and I felt bad for the fouling so I started pulling my men away from the ball handler.&nbsp; Wit like 3 secs I left I went for it to make it look close, they fouled I got the loose ball and I jacked up the 3... it rimmed around for a sec and fell in at the buzzer.&nbsp; We laughed hysterically and gave each other daps.&nbsp; But I'm sure he knew as well as I did that it was the cheapest win ever.&nbsp; I didn't say anything but still... cheap.&nbsp; Finally we went home and after a shower I feel asleep rite away.  Weirdest thing happened tho.&nbsp; I almost never remember anything I dream about.&nbsp; But today I can remember exactly what happened.&nbsp; I was here at home, I think on front of my comp.&nbsp; For some reason&nbsp;I did something to tell people that if they loved me they should come to my door.&nbsp; Someone came (don't worry not HER) and we looked at each other passionately in the eyes.&nbsp; Then I leaned forward and kissed her as I slowly&nbsp;we slowly&nbsp;moved&nbsp;till her back was against the wall.&nbsp; We stood there kissing for a while before I finally led her outside my hall and we sat down on the flat part of the stairwell.&nbsp; I sat against the wall while she sat on right on front of me so that I could wrap my arms around her.&nbsp; I'm not sure how it came about, but eventually I told her something and that I had already promised my heart to someone else... just then I woke up.&nbsp; The odd thing is, I don't remember who the girl is.&nbsp; I know she's shorter than me&nbsp;cuz I recall leaning forward and down to kiss her... but I still dunno.&nbsp; Something tells me that she's from Mowat too... hmm... any dream interpreters out there?  On the bright side it's good to know that in my dreams I can still uphold my morals and values. ^.^  Thx for reading, Warren  [8/5/9] (these #s don't express how much I miss you all)

      Today was ok, but since this is only based on one day theres not much content here. :(&nbsp; Wait... maybe thats good for those of you who read this but regret it half way through the long posts...   I woke up at 6.&nbsp; Yes!!! 6!!!&nbsp; I got up at 5:45ish to get a drink and couldnt sleep after that.&nbsp; I then proceeded downstairs and did my usual morning thing.&nbsp; I then played some more of the WC3 campaign.&nbsp; Afterwards I took a shower and got dressed to go to the pickering flea market.  The flea market was exactly how I imagined.&nbsp; A huge open place wit hundreds of lil booths.&nbsp; I hadn't gone there before so I was kinda excited.&nbsp; I had $200 in my pocket and I was ready to spend all of it!&nbsp; Well I started off the day very shy, afraid to ask any questions.&nbsp; But as I went from clothing booth to booth I got more into things.&nbsp; Asking the price of this and what they have in that size.&nbsp; Well, to keep a long story short, I left wit a pair of lite blue jean shorts, some dark blue RocaWear jeans, and a black and white "name brand" tee.&nbsp; I use the quotations cuz they have a name on the front but expert analysists (my friends) tell me that the tees are bootleg... hahaha, o well, i got some great prices.&nbsp; Usually a nice pair of jeans are at least $80.&nbsp; I payed $60 for the jeans and a white tee.&nbsp; And the shorts look very boot, but for $25 how can u go wrong?&nbsp; I payed approx. $25 in tees, nice ones wit decent designs.&nbsp; Reg tees that size usually go for 2 for $30.&nbsp; Did I get a good deal?.... I like to think so.   Afterwards my friend came over and we ran some INTENSE MvC2.&nbsp; He usually owns me but I had the xbox advantage.&nbsp; To keep this short we played for like 4+ hrs and at the end I was prolly up 8 games or so.&nbsp; If we did this at the arcade we woulda spent at least $10 on quarters.&nbsp; He's used to the dreamcast controllers while I love the xbox.&nbsp; The only diff besides the size and shape is that xbox has 2 xtra buttons that serve as PP and KK.&nbsp; This is key for dashing in linxing out supers.&nbsp; He didnt take advatange of this and strained to get supers sometimes while I cant play w/o it and abused it to my heart's content.&nbsp; But anywhere besides xbox means me getting fooded.&nbsp; After he got strained in WC3 we finally reached the courts.   When we got there, some guys were getting ready to play hockey where the net wit the mesh is so we played on another one.&nbsp; We ran a rematch of around the world and he took 1 and I took 2.&nbsp; Then I shot around and watched another game going on as my friend talked to a girl (I'm sure) on the phone.&nbsp; After, that we ran 1v1.&nbsp; The first game was on the same net we started on.&nbsp; He won and then we moved to the mesh net.&nbsp; Then he beat me 2 more times before we called it a day.   After a short chat I took a shower and here I am... my fam ate out again w/o me and I'm hungry...  On a side note, my posts lately seem to have been bothering my only fan left, so lemme explain a few things.&nbsp; Here's the main thing:  "I knew that if I ever "loved" someone who "loved" me back then I wouldn't hesitate to commit..."  No, she didn't confess love...  "I promised my heart to the first person who seemed like they  might  take it."  Might is the keyword, she seemed like she might... that means 0.01% chance... which is more than I ever had.  Anyways, see ya later... all 1 of you who MIGHT read this...

      Here's what ya missed the last 2 days:   ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   Friday:  Hmm... did the usual morning thing on the comp.&nbsp; At about 3:30ish I went upstairs to take a nap before work.&nbsp; I took a shower at 4:30.&nbsp; Got to work at 5:02.  Work was so boring!&nbsp; Worked the grocery order from 5-7:30.&nbsp; I then took an extended break till just before 8 and faced the store.  It was the after-work stuff I remember.&nbsp; As soon as I arrived I checked my blog to see an interesting comment.&nbsp; At midnite that person came on and we chatted.&nbsp; It seems that he believes that what I have said is impossible.&nbsp; Well I hope to be the first to prove him wrong!!!&nbsp; Wait... well I don't really want that to happen unless... well nvm.&nbsp; Her happiness is the KEY.&nbsp; My purpose is merely to see it happen.&nbsp; A or B... it's all good.&nbsp; But even if A was to happen, thats not 100% happiness either cuz I know that some1 else out there isn't 100% happy.&nbsp; Nothing = 100% happiness.&nbsp; It's just a question of how close u can get.&nbsp; And the closest I will ever get is knowing that she's at the closest she will ever get.  100%... No,&nbsp; but I will be 99.9% from A or B...  And keep striving for your dreams.&nbsp; They're urs if u want it...   Someone else on msn made me realise me fickleness.&nbsp; I promised my heart to the first person who seemed like they might take it.&nbsp; Then again, I always knew that I would do that.&nbsp; I knew that if I ever "loved" someone who "loved" me back then I wouldn't hesitate to commit... Ya, the single life is not for me.&nbsp; Then again, it's all I've ever had, so I dunno any better.  What? Wondering what's wit the "love"?&nbsp; Cuz it's such an abused word, everyone uses it when they dont mean it.&nbsp; That's why I hesitated to use it but did for lack of a better one.&nbsp; Have I ever known love?&nbsp; I dunno... but if this isn't it then I never have... and it seems like I've made it so that after this I never will.   Today (Saturday)  I was SUPPOSED to be at work at 9.&nbsp; Well I woke up at 8:20   Yo, I got time....   **Returns to sleep**   Ah ya... nothing like that extra 5 mins sleep... What time is it?...   **Checks time**   8:50!!!! Head buss....   (Excuse the slang)  Well, I jumped outta bed and took a shower.&nbsp; I was out at 9:10   Meh, I'm late so I might as well take my time   **starts Usher - Confessions**   Woooo.... Usher's too good!   **sings along**   I got to work at 9:22... I said sorry to my manager and he said it was alrite.&nbsp; Then I took out some bread and dropped the top "shell" right on front of him&nbsp; What a way to get more hours huh??&nbsp; Anyways, after bread, ice, and the sugar my friend came in...  I JUST realised that I forgot to fill the water.&nbsp; My manager is in tmr morning and will notice that too.&nbsp; Wow I struggle...  Well my friend who I go "church hopping" (lol that sounds so nerdy) wit came in as usual.&nbsp; We talked some more and he told me he got the job!!!! YAY!!!&nbsp; But I wont see him at UTSC next year... O well, can't have everything.&nbsp; But I am happy for him!!&nbsp; He told me that he set the bar for his pay so high that he thought it guaranteed that he wouldnt take it.&nbsp; Guess he didn't set it high enough...  There are some decent sales at Dominion this week:  Beatrice OJ - $0.99 - down from $2.19 I think...  McCain Pies - $0.99 - dunno whats the reg price...  NO!!!&nbsp; They are not paying me to say this!! ò.ô.... jks  These are the sales I took advantage of today.&nbsp; I also got hooked up from my bro's friend at McDs... sweet.&nbsp; I spent less than $5 today and got soooo full.&nbsp; As usual I told him what I've been up to lately.&nbsp; He said I was "pimpin it" again and I said "hahaha... no".&nbsp; We're reaching another church tmr.&nbsp; A mainly black dominated "revival" church.&nbsp; (No offense to u black or revivalist or read this... aprrox none)   After falling asleep on my bed I went to run some ball.&nbsp; As soon as I got there some strugglers asked me to play.&nbsp; Wow I was straining, missing open jumpers and such.&nbsp; Then one of urs rolled his ankle (I know how that goes) and some lil kid subbed in.&nbsp; My immediate thoughts was "wow well we lost", but this kid was decent.&nbsp; He even popped a few nice shots.&nbsp; He doubled dribbled and travelled alot but he was still decent for a lil kid.&nbsp; Well finally I popped 2 clutch pull-ups in my man's eye to seal the game.  Then my friend came and the strugglers got scared off.&nbsp; Well not really but they did leave.&nbsp; For a while my friend and I shot around.&nbsp; He told me how I sucked at sc and what i gotta do to get better:  Dl 10 reps of each matchup (3 in total) and study and learn em all, then train for a solid month and u'll be good.

      I haven't blogged in awhile... so here's some of what I did:  Weds: Work, got home, learned of truth from Will, went to sleep hurt and teary-eyed.  Thurs: Work...  Fri: Work  Sat: Work, ball, talked to Will some more  Sunday: Work then church wit a friend.  We visited the Ebenezer Revival Church which is mainly dominated by African-Canadians.  We both hoped that there would be ppl dancing in the aisles and an extra-enthusiastic speaker... they went 2 for 2.  It was crazy!!  Very much like the movies...  Monday: My only day off till at least next Sunday

      Life's been quite mediocre lately... and I'm feeling extra lazy. So I'll just quickly skim through things.  I been working as usual. I think I hate my job now. Then again I got paid yesterday. I finally broke the $300 mark!! ^_^ hehe... now I gotta give $250 to my parents...  I went to TD instead youth wednesday to get my student line of credit. Got approved. Now I just gotta go and sign it and get em to pay my tuition and I'm good for the year. Hopefully my work doesn't close down cuz I need to still pay for monthly interest.  I also have a big mouth...  My dilemna: should I play SC or Star Wars: KOTOR?  That's about all my life has to offer, here's a song that has ALOT of meaning :P  Jesus Walks (remix) - Kanye West and Mase   (Verse One - Kanye West)   Between the girls in the jury   The devil tryin’ lure me, fury me   (Mase) Jesus walks wit me   My Pastors shakin’ his head, He ain’t sure of me, but surely   (Mase) Jesus walks wit me,   They asked, do you say your prayersAt least two a week?   I ain’t talking to god,I know what I’ve been doin’ G   Do you know how I be embarrassed?   My prayers sound like Ben Stiller’s on Meet the Parents    And I ain’t good, at that "give us this day"   The slaves is trying to give us this free,   I’m trying to give us this pay   Man, you know how ‘dem strippers was   We was all ‘ghetto fabulous’ All at the rooms in the Cyberus   From this Jacuzzi water, Can you cleanse us?   Can you please unfold my Cardiare Lenses?    God sends signs sometimes only in glimpses   For me I almost died, Falling asleep in the Benz   It’s something about this beat that get me tranquilized   And when I play it at my show I feel sanctified    And he gives me direction when I can’t decide   He is alive   How can you tell me that he ain’t, When I said,       -Jesus Walks-(Kanye) God show me the way, now the devil can’t break me down   -Jesus walks with me- (Kanye) The only thing that I pray is that my feet don’t fail me now   -I want Jesus-(Kanye) And now I think there is something that I can say now that’ll right my wrongs   -Jesus walks with me-(Kanye) I finally talked to God, I ain’t afraid ‘cuz his love is so strong      (Verse 2 - Mase)   Come on, Come on, Before you take my name   Take my fame   Why you had to take my shame?   Take my flaws   Take my blame   Feel my dirt, Conceal my hurt   See my bruise   Do this and you will walk in my shoes   You wasn’t there when I was in deep thought   When I had two choices,   Kill him, or either leave New York   But I’m a true teller (yeah,)   That’s why I say what I’m saying (yeah)   And the only thing the radio is playing Is because you be payin   It ain’t about who really hot no more   Beasts will knock no more   So who cares? Who flock no more?   I realize that most labels pay you for lies   And only law dudes can disguise   That’s your favorite artist (shhh)   I know you hear that (huh?)   You wanna fear that? (what?)   Your worst dream is that you was gonna hear that   I and Kan’ to rap this like John the Baptist   Prepared the way,   For what I came to say today   They deceived us,   Having thinking Jesus   Really didn’t need us   When he loved up all you   He loved the boys in the hard days up in broad day   Even those who be here for dope, every four days   To the strippers in broad day up in Norway   To the Detroit player gators up in more ways   With me, its not just bars and music   I walk with god   I got the scar to prove it      -Jesus Walks-(Kanye) God show me the way, now the devil can’t break me down   -Jesus walks with me- (Kanye) The only thing that I pray is that my feet don’t fail me now      (Outro - Mase)    Everybody out there,   Just lift your hands right now   Just say this with me   Father, I thank you For forgiving me of everything I’ve ever done   For Jesus walking with me   For dying for me   Raising for meAnd all my sins have been forgiven   I’m a changed man   I’m healed, I’m delivered, I’m rich   And it’s all because of him   Now walk with me   Walk wit me, walk, walk, walk wit me   Walk wit me

       [11:36:05 AM] Matt (8) My : warren   [11:36:56 AM] Matt (8) My : ada asked me to go to see i robot cuz she wanted to spend more time with me b4 she left, then i asked will, dont get the wrong idea   [11:38:14 AM] Matt (8) My : and i wasnt puttin on no play...i jus didnt tell u cuz its not my thing to tell...if u wanna hate me then go ahead...i deserve it   [11:39:23 AM] Matt (8) My : and i've barely talked to will or ada since i got bak   [11:42:18 AM] Matt (8) My : fine...if u wanna give me the worse of it for something i wasn't really involved in and i didn't know until after u started tellin me stuff....dont think i knew about everything the whole time....i found out like half way through...and when i found out i tried to stop talking about it....cuz really it wasnt my thing to tell....but go ahead, hate me   [11:51:10 AM] Matt (8) My : i know i was a jerk for not tellin u....but look at the big pic...whos more of a jerk, me for not tellin u, or u for doing this    [12:13:38 PM] Mangy: haha... so im a jerk for doing this huh...    [12:14:07 PM] Matt (8) My : i dont care anymore, b mad at me    [12:14:12 PM] Mangy: fine     [12:14:28 PM] Mangy: listen... u can have ada too... im finished    OK, I wasn't gonna stay mad forever. Eventually I woulda given up this "grudge" and tried to get it how it was before. I said you had the worst of it rite now, Matt, cuz I hadn't heard the apology yet and I was still mad. I was eventually gonna say it was ok, and that I understood ur situation.  But u called me a jerk...  So who wants to be friends wit a jerk? I'm not sure if I would want to. I didn't think any of u were jerks for doing what u did cuz I assumed it was cuz you didn't wanna hurt me. But apparently I'm a jerk. Fine... so be it. Matt, I'm a jerk for being upset that someone I trusted didn't tell me what was going on. I'm a jerk cuz I didn't talk to you for a few days. I'm a jerk cuz u msged me on msn and I didn't respond cuz I was on sc (notice the status). I didn't wanna end these friendships, but if I'm the jerk... then you won't have to speak to jerks anymore.  I'm not into getting in between friends either. So Will, Ada, you don't have to choose between friends, I'll decide for you. Will, I will miss you when you go to school in September. Ada, I will always love you.  There, now it's over...

      Wow, it's cold in here. And I gotta do some laundry... but first ima procrascinate by doing this post.  Saturday: I was scheduled for 9-4:30, I woke up at 8:55 so I was late as usual. Got to work and did some work... our manager is gone for vacation so we got some lady as a sub... iunno, I just don't like her too much. Thankfully work went by pretty fast that day. Afterwards, even tho I was tired from all the work I've been doing lately, I went outside to run some ball. Wooo.... my shot is WET. Like honestly... I've never been so confident in my shot in my life. I played my friend 1on1, and the whole time he just didn't understand. Well, I'm a big guy so I'm known mostly for my post play, so when I was draining my shots he couldn't figure it out. There were 4 of us there so we ran some 2on2 after. They were pretty fair teams, tho my teammate had a very hard time stopping his man. My shot continued then too. We won the first game and lost the next like 3. But the real fun part was standing in the fountain... hehe... good times.  Sunday: Ran some sc in the morn then took my shower and went out wit the family. We dropped off some movie at Blockbuster then we went to the National Sports across the street from there in Pickering at my request. When I told them I wanted to go I thought they still had mad shoes like before... now all they got is some bootleg "SLAM" basketball shoe. I did find a good deal on some Nike hoodies... $29.99. Not bad considering in the winter they go for about $80. I also bought a ball shirt. It's made out of that shiny material that causes liquids to like slide off, Durasheen or something. That was also on sale for $19.99. So I did the math and calculated $57.49 after taxes so I bust out $60 in my hand while the cashier was ringing it through. Then she asked for $46... and was like "huh?", don't worry, I wasn't complaining. I also noticed she had a PUSH braclet on her left wrist... did she hook me up cuz of that?? ... hahaha... prolly just an honest mistake that I took advantage of. Afterwards it was time for some DQ. Mmmmm... I got the large brownie batter blizzard. It was so chocolatey, like I'm sure they just took some vanilla ice cream and added alota brownie batter in it and mixed it up. Then again that's what their ad said... When we left my parents decided to take us to a movie ^_^. It was kinda a struggle when we were brainstorming movies to see on the way cuz b/w me and my bro we had seen 4 relatively new releases, but when we checked the movie listings at Morningside we decided to see the Bourne Supremacy. We were 2 hrs early so my parents and little bro went to the nearby Wal-Mart while my older bro and I stayed in the arcade. At first we ran some Time Crisis 2 (ya the old one t.t) but it was pretty good. Then we started taking turns playing this basketball shooting thing. Argh!! It got me so mad cuz the ceiling is so low. Like I'm kinda tall and when I shoot I put alota arc in my shot, so alota the time when I shot it hit the ceiling. I had the record first wit 23 then 29. But my bro broke it wit 33. You get bonus time after u hit 30 so the key was getting there first. He ran outta money but I kept on going to beat him. But I swear that game cheats... like I even pointed out to my bro when it wouldn't count my baskets. Eventually I crushed his rec wit a 38 and retired as champ... that was after $20 in tokens... LOL! Finally we went to wait outside the theatre. There was a movie still playing there, something about "Thunderbirds", so we waited outside. As people started waiting with us, one of the Deli ppl from my store arrived and said hi, then a few mins later a guy I know from grocery came by for the same movie too. The movie was pretty good - 3.5/5. Alota killing and intense chases... always good. Iunno, I think I kinda expected a little more... Well after that we went to the Swiss Chalet across the street. It was so empty inside I thought they were closed! When we finally got served I figured why cuz the service sucked. It was a decent meal and I paid for most of it. But we're not going back there again.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Well know I guess I gotta address certain ppl...  Will, I commented ur blog so check that. We still are friends...  Matt, I do care that your back, despite still not saying anything to you. I'm sure that Will or Ada filled you in why not. You and Ada both had a countdown here (check earlier posts) but I ended both of them when I found out. You were the one who I felt I could talk to the easiest about what was happening, but you didn't tell me either... I guess at Ada's request. Even tho she is ur best friend, I still don't hold you any less accountable than the other two. I may not be your best friend, but if you were willing to call me a friend at all then I believe that I deserved to know. Don't worry, I'm not gonna be a jerk and start telling ppl the things you've told me, tho the thought has crossed my mind a few times. But as far as I'm concerned, everything that happened since I told Ada how I felt to now was all an act you put on... Trust is a dangerous thing.  But you still have the title of "friend" in my books if that's what ur wondering.  Yet it seems you got the worse of it.  I forgave Ada alot easier than I thought I would (stupid weak heart) and Will and I spoke once in person before he told me and that was when we say I, Robot.  But you I trusted the most...  Now I wonder, did Ada ask you guys to come cuz she was afraid I was gonna pull something?  At first I thought it was just cuz u both wanted to see her that last nite before she left, but now I think there were other reasons too... I ask this her rather than in private because I'm sure I woulda eventually asked all 3 of you, so I guess u guys can collaborate this one too now...  Hmm... now I'm thinking about alota things.  This post was supposed to end after my address to Matt but here I am still...  Ada... I still think about you every spare moment I have, but now its different things.  I have no idea what's going on between u and Will lately, and I can't even imagine what's been troubling you lately.  Alota the time I keep things inside cuz I don't wanna put any extra pressure on you... tho I guess from me posting here I'm doing it anyways (it is MY diary after all :P).  Sometimes I wonder... why did I forgive you so easily?  Why do I still try when you already told me that you weren't going to pursue romance anymore?  What do I expect to happen in the future?  Is there REALLY any space for me in ur busy, busy life?  What can I do that Matt and Will can't?  Am I making thing worse by wedging myself into your life?  What do you really feel for me?  ...then finally... if I was given a chance wit someone else, would I move on?...  I know that you've got more important things on your mind, so don't ponder these questions... in fact, knowing that your prolly gonna read this makes me wanna delete it, but I won't... don't bother with any of this till ur life is a little more stable.  As usual... I'm willing to wait as long as you need  It's funny how starting to write can set you off on other topics...

      Nothing like a good day of ball to exhaust you and let you fully enjoy sitting on front of your comp!  My body is sore all over... I LOVE IT!!!  That feeling of, "Yes, I did something constructive with my time."  What's so constructive you ask?  Well, I got some well-needed excercise, I got to work on my game, I got to completely destroy on of my friends I rarely see, and I got to play wit my bro and share some laughs.  The last thing was key, as we hardly spend time together with him working nites and sleeping in the morning and me go to work in the afternoon.  I also got to see someone I went to elementary school wit.  He was the best ball player then, and he is still amazing.  Like I wouldn't dare to play him 1on1.  He's getting some interest from some US universities, but he's going back to high school next year to  work on his game and marks.  I'm so happy for him, he's didn't fall into the many traps that high school has to offer...  I can also say that I have finally "Let it burn", tho I still wish you the best...  Matt, you said the next move is mine, so here it is... While you were still at that camp, I already forgave you.  I know it was unfair for you to get the most of my anger, but that's just how it happened.  Though I did get to see some of your truer colours.  I don't hate you, I just don't feel that urge I had before to speak to you over msn or see you outside of church.  When I see you next, I will smile and act like everything is normal, but I'm unsure whether it will be 100% sincere.  Ultimately, it was simply outside circumstances, hot tempers, and my pride that ended it.  I still read ur blog if ur wondering, and I still care.  I still think of you as a friend, tho not as highly as I once did.  Maybe one day things can be the way they were, or maybe that day will outlive us both...  On a brighter note, I can't wait for university for many reasons.  Alota ppl I know are going there, but more importantly, alot I don't.  I just really need to get that tuition paid off...  ARGH... my back hurts... ^_^ ... haha, I'ma sleep well tonite.
