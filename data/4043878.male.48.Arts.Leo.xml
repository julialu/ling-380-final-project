      Colleagues, Associates, Mentors, emerging artists and laypersons:  1: It&nbsp; has been great to be part of this Vancouver community and to develop my artistic career since I arrived here 24 years ago. To read and learn about&nbsp;the&nbsp;other points of view from the emailers and readers is an insight to the complexities of the human spirit, the world we occupy, and our final destinations.&nbsp; I thank you all for&nbsp; your support, criticisms, and challenges which hopefully shapes us into better people.&nbsp;As a cultural professional, filmmaker and performer, I am humbled by the work that I have seen and experienced over the years from the many talented people
