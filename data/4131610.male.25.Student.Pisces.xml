      Well i read a poem called why do we love who we love, I would like to answer that But that is like asking a bird why it flies, Or a fish why it swims.  The answer as to why lies in the stars That is of course you believe in destiny As for me i dont  So i have trouble answering that question on a general level On a personal level All you need to know is i do

      Its a sad thing when you start to feel nothing Sucked of all emotion You start to wonder  why you cant find beauty Even in a flower in full bloom Or feel the warmth of an infants first laugh  To feel guilty for a moment of weakness To second guess oneself  Not knowing how or why Complete bewilderment  But still knowing the only reason for this is love That is the only emotion i can still truly feel You gave that gift to me and i am thankful My muse, My love Forgive me.

      How do you appologise to someone you care deeply about? Even if you have done nothing wrong When they are in pain I feel it as well?  When they push you away  All you want to do is hold them Let them know your there  Why do I feel guilt? easy... Your pain is my pain My muse

      One relizes whats most important in agony A flash of how fragile we are  Is life worth living vicariously or wait in angst in boredom?  My motto has always been  " The harder we play the better the rest at the end"  What say you?

      Conscious or subconscious All we are is constructed on this Motives, emotions, reactions  Products of a totalitarian society Intergrating distorted truths and beliefs  Believing in ourselves And making our own decisions Is the only true freedom we have  But if beliefs and truths are distorted Has our freedom been lost?

      Infatuation of an intimite nature Lessons of love buried deep   Within the dank embrace of my inner sanctum Lies a power of chaotic distrust  Whats this? A warm sensation A glowing fire was built, How?  Darkness has been overwelmed with purity Innocence has been lit and the dank walls dry  The echoes of your emotions bring me to tears On my knees I cower And sob my thanks

      Shards of a mirror resting on the floor is this not our true reflection we see?  Broken pieces of our lifes imprint Our lies and hopes on display  Unity of ones self apppears in the chaos  Why in a moment of imperfection we see perfection?

      Waiting for an answer that will never come Whislt in angst second guessing others motorvations Are we supposed to live in complete autonomy and just sway a little on the monotoneous journey Or fly without wings and rely on hopes alone.  To live in vived dreaming is the closet we get to our fantasies only in dreams can we play our hopes  only in dreams are we happy  In my dreams I am complete

      Doubt replaces the void where hope resided Time passes and the pain subsides Hope slowerly works its way home  But if hope leaves again  Doubt breeds anger and hate  Contempt is the greatest power anyone can have its beyond anger and touches pure hatred  Hatred of oneself and anyone who opens your heart to hope again

      Its hard too see through the sheets of water veiling my eyes, coupled with the diminshing glow of sunlight  Looking down to carefully navigate the crevices and cracks in the earth  Ascention of dreams lie here written in benevalence Not unlike a symphony of love and passion  Bound together as one, rationalize empathy And create weakness  yet make us strong and pure.

      My affection is a bare desert Slave to wind and sand In the thoughts of none Needing recognition I am a wandering hermit in my desolate emotion Thinking leads to thoughts And in the distance of my desert i see a storm Sand engulfs me and i wimper at the pain Tears of blood fall and disapate into the scorched earth  Sorrow sings and is sweet to my ears The illusion is complete

      My dearest beloved,  With all i am, I am yours Our souls intertwine on the beaches of eternal bliss Our hearts beating in unison as we embrace I feel the warmth as you look deep into me The calmness is overwheling I give into your desire Love is not what i feel, it is beyond that I adore you  Yours,

      Is beauty in the soul or mind or is it an aura that is seen by so few  Gaze up at a waterfall Is what you see beauty? Or is it the hidden wonder of it that is beauty?  So is beauty a representation of visual pleasure or a deep mysterious attraction?  I will let you decide, I know which one it is for me

      Wilting in sorrow for time lost Glowing affection for hedonism in oneself Relief of demans that deepen fears A glimpse of life beyond empty Proof in absolutness Bliss and elatiion of desire  I have found her

      Is it a sin to need a scented blossom in spring Or to wonder in awe at a sunset melting through mountains  Maybe hearing the birds sing your praises every morning Or being greeted by the warm breeze on a summers day  To want warmth on a winters night And to make love by the moons gentle glow If so I confess to you  Every time I meet your gaze I live in sin.
