       Dear Viewers, thank you so much for viewing my website.Here you can't find your idol's biography except mine.There's simply just so much that i want to tell someone who are willing to lend his ears to listen to me. However,i couldn't find one. Now,i'm relying on this and only this to let it all out.     -[chatterbox_163@hotmail.com]Nurul -25th May 2004 (20:14)    I'm an average lil gal.I'm really damn talkative yol! tats y my fren, Sunarti gave me a nick,[chatterbox].People can see me hapi n smile but they dun noe wat's playing n bothering in my head! It was because, i dun tend to show them wat i felt n think! They simply judge me by my mistakes. They dun even think wat positives things i have done in the past.     Thank God that i'm a patient person! I tend to "play" things slow n juz keep goin on and on wif life. It was juz hurt!  NO WORDS COULD EXPLAIN THE PAIN I WAS SUFFERING ALL TIS WHILE.      There's alot of positives & negatives i have gone through in my life. From  FAMILY  to  SCHOOL  to  FRIENDSHIPS  to  JEALOUSY  to  RELATIONSHIPS  and  BACK TO ME . It was juz damn  complicated  wen i tink 'bout it! Ya it's true tat we're not supposed to think of our past. But i juz couldn't help it! I WANT A SOLUTION TO ALL TIS! IT MAY SEEMED TO HAVE BEEN SOLVED BUT IT WAS NOT!      It was true enough tat people actually judge me by my MISTAKES. Somehow,they tend to BELIEVE all nonsense from other people's mouth without investigate it at the first place! They blindly n stupidly spread to other idiots they know. Well, it was juz damn hurt man! Well, thanx 2 my kuzin for sueing one of the spreaders! (TATS HOW BAD I AM WEN THEY ARE TOO MUCH!) as for the rest, u better count urself lucky coz i dun caught u!
