      "Homosexuality is never mentioned explicitly by any character save when Gene says that Finny’s pink shirt makes him look like a “fairy.” But the relationships in the book are all between boys (we never see them interact with girlfriends or mothers, except for one brief scene with Leper’s mother), and the central relationship contains hints of an almost sexual attraction between Gene and Finny. When the boys go to the beach, for instance, Gene remarks that his friend’s skin “radiated a reddish copper glow of tan, his brown hair had been a little bleached by the sun, and I noticed that the tan made his eyes shine with a cool blue-green fire.” Although the language is not expressly homoerotic, Gene’s words suggest that the connection between him and Finny is, if not sexual, then at least strongly physical: the boys direct their affection toward each other’s whole beings, increasing the intensity of their bond."

Well it's a RP thing where DM puts us in stupid situations, and then we do stupid things. hiemdoshuevos: And then at the end you have to fight the dwarf, and you cannot win against the dwarf. hiemdoshuevos: Anyway. hiemdoshuevos: I chose, this game, to be Vannah White. Don't ask me why. I don't know. SelketRune: Wait, you were in Vannah White? hiemdoshuevos: No, I chose to RP -as- Vannah White. Like, she was my character. SelketRune: Oooooo! SelketRune: Okay. Continue. hiemdoshuevos: And throughout the entire game I kept collecting letters from things. Whenever I saw something with a letter on it, I took a letter from it. SelketRune: **Snickers** hiemdoshuevos: At the end, I'm staring down the Dwarf, and I still have the letters W, L, A, and N. hiemdoshuevos: So I use these letters to spell the word "LAWN", and cover The Dwarf with grass. He then caught fire. SelketRune: .....And? And?! hiemdoshuevos: He put himself out and then shot me in the face with a shotgun. hiemdoshuevos: Like I said, you can't beat The Dwarf."
