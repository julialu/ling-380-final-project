      I'm almost finished doing character profiles for my Twisted Fate story!! Whoo! I'm a procrastinator... I've been working on it for over a year now. XD;; Geez. I'll be ninety years old by the time I get it published. I just have two more characters to profile... Then I need to draw the ones I haven't drawn yet. Yeesh. That's the majority of them. o_O;;  Anyway... CORGI PUPPIES ARE DUE NEXT WEEK!! I can't wait any longer!! *explodes* oO; Yeee... Corgis!! I hope all goes well with the litter, and I hope I can get one! ^0^ I'm so excited!!  Okee, shutting up now.

      As promised, here's a pic of one of the corgis I got to play with while I was at the show on Saturday. I think his name was Lilith or something. oO; *can't remember*   This picture would have been perfect... If he hadn't blinked. XD;  And this is the red-headed tri girl that I talked about in the previous post. Ain't she cute?    Oh, and if y'd like to view my art gallery:  urlLink CLICK!

       YEEEE!! I went to a dog show in Delafield today!! ^-^ I got to see lots of corgis. I even brought home a piece of corgi fur and I put it in a bag&nbsp;to be worshipped&nbsp;by me!&nbsp;I'mnotobsessed. o.o Okee, maybe I am. I took lots of pictures, I might put them up here, when we get them developed. I got to play with corgis at the show, one of them really liked being scratched behind the ear. I'd scratch her ear and&nbsp;her head would tilt and her tongue would loll to the side... SO KYOOT!&nbsp;I can't wait! My puppy is due in one to two weeks!! ^___^ I'm so HAPPY!

       Ugh... Today was pretty darn boring. Not much to do.  &nbsp;  Actually, one interesting event was: The Lurker!  &nbsp;  I made a forum for the private use of myself and Shaz so we could do a roleplay... But aparently it wasn't as private as we thought. It kept saying there was a guest hanging on the forums... And they were there for a really long while, watching... Maybe it was a government spy sent to steal our brains and sap the creative juices so they can sell them&nbsp;on the black market.

        Winnie&nbsp;may not be in the way in this picture, but she sure is when I'm not trying to take a picture! She looks very innocent at the momnet, she's sleeping. Hrm. Must be tired from attacking the pillow I was using while playing Zelda.

       Urgh... Tired.  &nbsp;  I swear, I kicked the Winnie (the cat, if you didn't know) about three times during the night because she was sleeping at the end of my bed. I feel bad for her. o_O; I'm not used to having a cat sleep at the end of my bed so I'd wake up and I'd practically be strangling her with my feet.  &nbsp;  Jack's at the vet right now. Poor kitty. He cried the whole way there. I think we can take him home around 3 pm tonight though, so all will be good. ^-^  &nbsp;  *tries to look around Winnie's rear end as she blocks the computer screen* Gaaah... Stoopid cat, you're in the way! ._.' Now she's playing with a pencil...  &nbsp;  Aaah, anyway! I should probably shut up now... Yeah. I think I'll do that.

      Dude, I should not have had that Pepsi. I need to get up early tomorrow to take the cat to the vet for surgery and here I am at 11:00 wide awake. o_O; Prolly not good. Ah well, I the idiot shall recieve my just reward tomorrow when I am dragged out of bed screaming in protest. What fun.

      Yes! I called my breeder this morning and the corgi puppies were born this morning!! *squealgleejoy* They're all red and white, seven of 'em, four males and three females. I can't wait to go and see them in September!! ^-^  I went to the Pet Expo at the fairgrounds today and I got to see a corgi there. There were lots of dogs. Hamlet the Great Dane was there, and I think I saw an Irish Wolfhound there that I'd seen before at the PKC. There was a Borzoi that kept leaning on me, so kyoot. X3 The Ferret Rescue was there too. FERRET!! *hug*  Aaanyway... I'll just shut up, hey?

      I went to a bonfire at Cody's (B.) house last night. It rocked. Literally, considering we listened to Razor 94.7 the whole time. Anyway, it was Cody, Julia, Jorie, Spencer, and of course, myself. It was just hysterical. We spent the majority of the time playing word games. We had to go to the store to get hotdogs and the second Cody walked in, she asked: "What did we come here for?" XD ...Oh, and Spencer ripped Jorie's shirt. OO;; Don'task.  Most Hilarious Quote of the Night: "We're speaking in sentences!" -Cody  It was awesome. We have GOT to do that again before the end of summer vacation.  Okee, on to other matters...  CORGI PUPPIES!! They're due this week! I'm so excited!! I can't take it!! WHEEEE!! *bouncebouncebounce* They're going to arrive any day now!! ^-^ I hope there's a red and white female, I'd prefer a R&W female... But, I'm not going to be too choosy. As long as I get a corgi, I'll be happy. ^^  Okay, shuttingupnow.
