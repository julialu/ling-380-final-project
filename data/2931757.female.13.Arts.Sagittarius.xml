      A long silence stayed until the three reached Dimitri’s house.  They rushed inside.  Lewis and Elliot followed Dimitri down stairs and got into the basement.  Dimitri grabbed his violin and bow and said, “Hey guys, wanna rock out for a bit?”  The two laughed a little and picked an instrument.  Dimitri’s family was very musical, so Dimitri had learned to play quite a few instruments.  Lewis swung over to the piano and sat on the bench.  Elliot snagged the bass that was taller than him.  Dimitri set the bow to the violin while the others steadied themselves.  The bow struck the violin and produced a sultry low sound.  He played the song he had made up himself.  Dimitri opened his eyes to see Lewis and Elliot staring at him.  Dimitri stopped and said, “what?"  Lewis broke out of his trance and said,       "I didn't know you were so good at violin.  I mean-I-knew-you-were-good... but I didn't know you were THAT good!"  Dimitri shook his head and raised the violin and bow again.  He played for his friends and his friends played for him.  Until it was time for them to leave, Lewis and Elliot flashed looks of amazement or jealousy at Dimitri.  After they left, he began his long haul of homework.  Chapter 2        I had to run.  I had to go.  This was no life for me.  I couldn’t continue living this.  This lie people call my life.  It wasn’t right.  It wasn’t good.  I had to go faster.  Faster!  I have to run!  Go!  No one’s behind you...go!         I run faster, memories, those awful memories, flash through my head.  My name isn’t Jennifer!  My name is...is...I don’t know, but it’s not that!  I don’t know!  Leave me alone you awful, terrible men!  Don’t touch me!  No!  Not the dog!  Not the DOG!  I hate that dog!  The cold blue eyes!  The warm breath about to tear my neck open.  I think...in my last moment...it’s over...finally over...I’m free...I’m gone. * * *       Dimitri’s eyes snapped open.  He was covered in cold sweat, and it was 3:37 AM.  Dimitri thought to himself, what a strange dream.  He fumbled for a moment and grabbed a pencil and his dream notebook.  He scribbled down the dream by the light of the street lamp outside his window.  He grabbed the can of soda, which he usually kept by his bed, and took a swig.  He settled back into his place, a little unnerved by the dream.       When he woke to the incessant beeping of his alarm clock , he didn’t remember any of the dream.  He laid in bed.

            Even though Dimitri had only known Lewis and Elliot for around six months, he already knew them well enough to trust them with his life.  Elliot and Lewis knew could trust each other and Dimitri with their lives, so they didn’t trouble with most things, like telling a secret.  The three did occasionally keep secrets from each other, but it was never big.         Lewis looked back at Dimitri, who was staring at the wall.  “Hey man,” said Lewis, “you okay?”  Dimitri slowly turned his head to look into Lewis’s eyes.  Lewis said,       “Is something wrong?”  Dimitri opened his mouth slowly and said in a monotone voice,       “Lewis, I’m pregnant.”  Lewis looked shocked for a moment and started laughing.  He managed to stop for a moment to catch a breath of air and say,       “With who’s baby?”  Dimitri had a glazed look in his eyes, yet they sparkled like a mischief makers.  He pointed over to Elliot, who was reading a book.       “His,” said Dimitri dully.  Elliot lifted his head with a surprised look on his face and said,       “Eh?  Did someone say my name?”         “Uh, yeah,” said Lewis.  “I hear tell you made Dimitri pregnant.”  Elliot looked dazed for a moment and said, “right,” and continued about his reading.  The two laughed for a bit until their male teacher, Mr. Worsley, said, “hey!  You two, back there!  Shut it!”  He had a thick moustache and his eyes twinkled with laughter.  He was a lot of people’s favorite teacher.        After school, the three met up outside Lewis’s locker.  He was having trouble opening it.  He gave the locker a last bang with his foot and cursed loudly, “darn you, Agnes!”  Out of boredom, Lewis had named his locker Agnes, as well as his binder, which he named Horhay.  Elliot walked up to Lewis’s locker, peered down at Lewis who was sitting on the floor next to his locker with his head in his hands.  He grumbled a few things to himself.  Elliot knew the combination to his locker.  48... 22... 13... thought Elliot as he turned the lock.  The locker opened and Lewis sprang up to cry “Hallelujah!  The lord has come!”  He shook Elliot’s hand and grabbed his backpack and binders and books and shoved them all in quickly.  He leaned up against the lockers and ran his hand through his hair.  Elliot saw a few girls behind him sigh and clutch their binders tighter, as if their lives depended on it.  Lewis said,        “So, who’s house are we going to today?”  Elliot and Dimitri looked at each other and Dimitri said,       “Well, yesterday we went to Elliot’s, so... why don’t we go to mine?”       “Yeah sure, you betcha,” said Elliot.  They began on their way to Dimitri’s house, which wasn’t a very long walk from the school.  To make conversation, Dimitri said,       “Hey, you guys, I had a pretty weird dream last night.”       “Oh, did you now?” said Elliot.       “Do tell,” said Lewis.       “Well,” began Dimitri, “it started out that I was in my room or something, and it looked like I was crying.  I think I was a girl because I guy came in a put his hand on my shoulder.  I guess I got up and stormed out of the room, because the guy looked really sad and he just sat on my bed.  I went into the forest and then I collapsed, I think,  and this big dog came and killed me.”  The three had stopped.  Lewis had his eyes closed with his head pointing to the sky, his small devilish smile upon his face.  Elliot stared at Dimitri and Dimitri stared back at him.  “What?” asked Dimitri.       “You know what I was in my past life?” said Lewis, now looking at Dimitri with glassy eyes.       “What?” asked Dimitri.  Lewis wet his lips and went over to Dimitri.       “You may not believe me, but I was a horse.”  Dimitri laughed.       “No seriously,” said Lewis, “horses are noble creatures.  I was a free horse.  And I was black.  I could run faster than any of the other horses in my herd.  It seemed like I could fly...if only I could.”  A pause.  Elliot broke the silence and said,       “That’s...creepy.”

      well, I have a new blog.  Surprise surprise!  I'll let you in on a little secret.   I'm writing a book!  Here's the first part I have, not mush or anything, just an introduction to the characters:  Forward Motion  Chapter 1        Dimitri sat on his chair at school.  He was aware that he had a look of sadness, or depression on his face, but he was just thinking.  He always looked like that when he was thinking.  At first, it worried people to see him like that, but once they were informed of his thinking habits, they paid him no mind.  What was he thinking about was the question.  And the answer is, as always; everything.  The thought process leading from one thing to another, a never ending chain.       Dimitri wasn’t what you’d call a normal boy.  He had his quirks and used them to his advantage.  He had a few friends, most of them not very good because they only wanted him around since he was a good listener and was loyal.  Dimitri only had two comrades that were really his friends, one of them happed to be a sixteen year old by the name of Lewis.  The other was Elliot, another sixteen year old with a strange, but good sense of humor.         Lewis had red hair on the left half of his head, and black on the other and was very wild most of the time.  His right nostril was pierced and he had a devilish smile.  Lewis also had intriguing blue eyes.  He sat in front of Dimitri during language arts and social studies, which took up a total of two periods, each one hour long.  Elliot had curly, almost-short brown hair.  He always had a leather jacket that smelled, as he said, “like grandpa.”  Elliot sat next to Lewis on the left side.  Dimitri had dark brown hair that hung in front of his face and had just a bit of curl to it.  He had dark green eyes.         Elliot was a tall boy and just a bit gangly.  Lewis was shorter and was built like a runner.  Dimitri had nearly the same figure as Lewis but was about an inch taller.  The three knew that a lot of the girls at the school fancied Lewis.  Elliot often times caught them looking at a stolen picture of him that they had snapped or had pawned off another girl.  Lewis had never had a girlfriend or a relationship of any kind, and it appeared he had no plan to start one.  None of the three, know as “those weird kids,” had any interest at all in dating or girls.

       HERMIONE: I’ve filled these cupcakes with an animal tranquilizer.   my door slowly creaks open   HALDIR: Argh, foiled again! Oh, well. Let’s all go put on miniskirts and play Twister.     SNAPE: First off, they didn’t have indoor plumbing hundreds of years ago. That means that this sink was installed after the creation of the Chamber of Secrets. Thus we can assume that not only did the person who installed this sink not notice the giant underground labyrinth of impending doom behind it, but he also just so happened to put in a unique faucet with a snake on it precisely where it needed to be. Not to mention the fact that back when the Chamber was first opened there was not yet any reason for people not to use this bathroom, and so presumably they did, and the heir got away with everything in a public restroom. Not only that but a women’s restroom where he would have been rather conspicuous anyway.    DOBBY: (pulls a pink thong out of the diary) Master has given Dobby clothes!  LUCIUS: What? That’s not mine.  HARRY: No, it’s mine! And what’s more, I was able to remove the thong and place it in the diary so quickly because your very own son has betrayed you!      yes!

Read this:  This guy comes home from work one day to find his dog with the neighbor's pet rabbit in his mouth. The rabbit is dead and the guy panics. He thinks the neighbors are going to hate him forever, so he takes the dirty, chewed up rabbit into the house and gives it a bath, blow dries its fur and puts the rabbit back into the cage at the neighbor's house, hoping they will think it died of natural causes. A few days later, the neighbor is outside and asks the guy, "Did you hear that Fluffy died?" The guy stumbles around and says, "Um.. no.. um.. what happened?". The neighbor replies, "We just found him dead in his cage one day, but the weird thing is that the day after we buried him we went outside and someone had dug him up, gave him a bath and put him back into the cage. There must be some real sick people out there!"    Still think so?  Try this:  A blonde named Anna had a near death experience. The other day when she went horseback riding. Everything was going fine until the horse started bouncing out of control. She tried with all her might to hang on, but was thrown off. Just when things could not possibly get worse, her foot got caught in the stirrup. When this happened, she fell head first to the ground. Her head continued to bounce harder as the horse did not stop or even slow down. Just as she was giving up hope and losing consciousness, the Wal-Mart manager happened to walk by and unplug it.  You sure?  Give this a shot:  Late one night, a burglar broke into a house that he thought was empty. He tiptoed through the living room but froze in his tracks when he heard a loud voice say, "Jesus is watching you."  Frantically, he looked all around. In a dark corner, he spotted a bird cage and in the cage was a parrot. "Was that you who said Jesus is watching me?"  "Yes", said the parrot.  The burglar breathed a sigh of relief, then asked, "What's your name?"  "Clarence," said the bird.  "That's a dumb name for a parrot," sneered the burglar. "What idiot named you Clarence?"  "The same idiot who named the Rottweiller, Jesus."    Really?  Here:  For all of you who occasionally have a really bad day when you just need to take it out on someone, don't take that bad day out on someone you know.  Instead, take it out on someone unfriendly who you don't know!  Now get this. I was sitting at my desk, when I remembered a phone call I had to make. I found the number and dialed it.  A man answered nicely saying, "Hello?"   I politely said, "This is Patrick Hannifin and could I please speak to Robin Carter?"  Suddenly, the phone was slammed down on me! I couldn't believe that anyone could be that rude.  I tracked down Robin's correct number and called her. I had transposed the last two digits incorrectly.  After I hung up with Robin, I spotted the wrong number still lying there on my desk. I decided to call it again.  When the same person once more answered, I yelled "You're a jackass!" and hung up.  Next to his phone number I wrote the word "jackass," and put it in my desk drawer.  Every couple of weeks, when I was paying bills or had a really bad day, I'd call him up.  He'd answer, and I'd yell, "You're a jackass!"  It would always cheer me up.  Later in the year, the phone company introduced caller ID.  This was a real disappointment for me; I would have to stop calling the jackass.  Then, one day, I had an idea.  I dialed his number, then heard his voice, "Hello."   I made up a name. "Hi, this is Mike Smith with the sales office of the telephone company and I'm just calling to see if you're familiar with our caller ID program?"  He went, "No!" and slammed the phone down.  I quickly called him back and said, "That's because you're a jackass!"  The reason I took the time to tell you this story is to show you how if there's ever anything really bothering you, you can do something about it -- just dial my good ol' friend, the jackass, at 555-1111.  [Keep reading! It gets better.]  An old lady at the mall really took her time pulling out of the parking place. I didn't think she was ever going to leave.  Finally, she got the car in reverse and she began to move ... very slowly backing out of the slot.  I backed up a little more to give her plenty of room to pull out.  Great, I thought, she's finally leaving.   All of a sudden this black Camaro comes flying up the parking aisle in the wrong direction and pulls into her space.  I started honking my horn and yelling, "You can't just do that, Buddy. I was here first!"  The guy climbed out of his Camaro completely ignoring me. He walked toward the mall as if he didn't even hear me.  I thought to myself, "This guy's a jackass!" There sure a lot of jackasses in this world.  Then I noticed he had a "For Sale" sign in the back window of his car. I wrote down the number then hunted for another place to park.  A couple of days later, I'm at home sitting at my desk. I had just gotten off the phone after calling 555-1111 and yelling, "You're a jackass!" (It's really easy to call him now since I have his number on speed dial.)  I noticed the phone number of the guy with the black Camaro lying on my desk and thought I'd better call this guy, too.  After a couple rings, someone answered the phone and said, "Hello."  I said, "Is this the man with the black Camaro for sale?"  "Yes, it is."  "Can you tell me where I can see it?"  "Yes, I live at 1802 West 34th street. It's a yellow house and the car's parked right out front."  I said, "What's your name?"  "My name is Don Hansen."  "When's a good time to catch you, Don?"  "I'm home in the evenings."  "Listen Don, can I tell you something?"  "Yes."  "Don, you're a jackass!" And I slammed the phone down.  After I hung up, I added Don Hansen's number to my speed dialer.  For a while, things seemed to be going better for me.  Now, when I had a problem, I had two jackasses to call.   Then, after several weeks of calling the jackasses and hanging up on them, it just wasn't as enjoyable as it used to be.  I gave the problem some serious thought and came up with a solution.  First, I had my phone dial Jackass #1.  A man answered nicely saying, "Hello."  I yelled "You're a jackass!", but I didn't hang up.  The jackass said, "Are you still there?"  I said, "Yeah."  He said, "Stop calling me."  I said, "No."  He said, "What's your name, Pal?"  I said, "Don Hansen."  He said "Where do you live?"  "1802 West 34th Street. It's a yellow house and my black Camaro's parked out front."  "I'm coming over right now, Don. You'd better start saying your prayers."  "Yeah, like I'm really scared, Jackass!" and I hung up.  Then I called Jackass #2.  He answered, "Hello."  I said, "Hello, Jackass!"  He said, "If I ever find out who you are..."  "You'll what?"  "I'll kick your butt."  "Well, here's your chance. I'm coming over right now, Jackass!" And I hung up.  Then I picked up the phone and called the police. I told them I was at 1802 West 34th Street and that I was going to kill my brother-in-law as soon as he got home.  I made another quick call to Channel 13 about the gang war going down on West 34th Street.   After that, I climbed into my car and headed over to 34th Street to watch the whole thing.  Glorious! Watching two Jackasses throwing punches and kicking one another in front of 6 squad cars, a police helicopter, and channel 13 news cameras!!!  It was one of the greatest experiences of my life!    I only wonder if that were true...   urlLink -S-S-S-Sarah

        You are...Super Gay Snape!  You're SUPER, thanks for asking, and hell, you'll tell people whether they ask or not!  Commonly found in fluffy canon-era slash fics of the not-so-good variety, you often come out to Harry before he even starts to flirt with you and then proceed to declare your undying love to the entire wizarding world.  Whether you're dressing in Armani or coloured leather pants, chances are that you have plans to read poetry to your latest flame while cuddled on the sofa sipping Green Iguanas, or to buy a big arrangement of flowers for Lupin.

      earlier today I was having a bath and eating nachos while thinking lewd thought of Snape.  I was wondering a few things to myself:  when is the pope going to die?  bu besides that I was wondering what other people do in the bath tub.  I can count the people who do the same things as me on one finger, but besides that, I was wondering what Snape would do in the bath and I came up with a small list:  read  National Geographic   draw undies on the natives smoke and think lewd thoughts  I was also wondering what Sirius and Lupid would do in a tub, and I came up with this:  Sirius:  Shave write wash his hair  Lupin:  accidenatlly fall asleep put bubbles in it listen to music  I thought about what Lewis would do in the bath tub:  eat nachos like me read sing think lewd thoughts   But then again, that's just my opinion.    the worst thing that could happen when you eat nachos in the bath tub is that they would all fall off into the water.  Which reminds me of a recipie for awesome nachos:  ingredients:  Pace Picante Salsa cheese tortilla chips  things you will need:  plate salsa cheese tortilla chips microwave cheese grater  Directions:  grate cheese put chips on plate put cheese on chips put in microwave until cheese has melted pour unreal amouts of salsa on it eat  you know?  I think that Peter Petigrew qould masturbate to a picture of James or Sirius in the bath tub.  Eating nachos in the bathtub is like a ritual for me.  I've been doing it for a long time, almost as long as I have always gotten SweetTarts at the movie theatre.  Whenever I go to the theatre, I always get SweetTarts or something relating to that kind of candy.  If I could, I would bring nachos to the theatre.  Or corndogs.    Or macaroni and cheese.   I just realized that I was sitting on a paper back book and I bent it really bad.  *shrugs*  when  is  the pope going to die?  Maybe he already has.  Maybe they had a replacement.  Maybe that old, decrepid thing that watches young boys break dance will never die.  Dude.  Whoa.  I guess that's one of life's little goddam mysteries.    When I was taking a bath, we have a shower curtain over it, so that's good, My mum wanted to get something.  She said  "can I come in?"  me: uh.. hang on   this is when I look down at the nacho plate that has a bunch of excess salsa goo on it.   I pull the plate into the bath with me, but not in the water if that's what you're thinking.  I lick off some of the salsa while she gets what she needs.  And that's all I have time for so maybe tomorrow you'll get to listen to my pure drivel, which is actually a book by Steve Martin.    urlLink -S-S-S-Sarah

       Lewis, I’m Only Dancing    typed in  SARAH VISION   also known as Snape has the Madd Skillz 	 if you see one of these “*” look to the bottom for the answer    Now, we all know that Snape probably doesn’t listen to music at all, in fact, he probably listens to day time talk shows on the radio, but that’s getting off the subject.  So, today we’ll have to change know (in the above sentence) to think.  Anyways, Snape was having a rough day.  He had stubbed his toe multiple times and Harry Pooter was being a crap.  Hermione was seriously crushing on him as was Draco.  And poor Snape had no romantic interest in either of them.  Well, maybe Draco’s father, but that would be Padfoot’s fault.    Anyways, today was the last day for the 7th years, which is the last year at Hogwarts, and if it isn’t, screw you, it’s my story.  Lewis, a satyr with a head of hair that was half red and half black, who had little horns poking out of it, was a 7th year.  He had always had an interest in Snape, and Sev was definitely going to miss the little guy.  Snape had not seen Lewis all day, and was feeling bad because he didn’t get to day good-bye.  I know this doesn’t sound like something Snape would do, but he had been through a lot with the little satyr.   Well, that was it.  It was over.  The 7th years were going home, and Snape had not seen Lewis since yesterday when he interrupted Snape when he was practicing his ^note: Sarah is having problems thinking of a good enough game for Snape so just insert some cool, manly game like Scrabble here.^ Snape went back to his dormitory... dungeon thing and put on some Queen music to cheer him up.   He was packing up his things when “Mr. Roboto” began to blast through the dungeon.  A lone figure stood in the doorway.  Snape gasped.  The lyrics started and the figure was mouthing them*.  He walked up to Snape, it was Lewis!  Now, you have to know, Snape had gotten a bit drunk* before hand so he wasn’t exactly sure what he was doing.  Lewis took Snape in his arms spun him around.  Snape’s first question was “how in bloody hell did you get in here?!?!” Lewis smirked and held up a small key.  “Did you miss me Sevvey?” asked Lewis, still holding Snape.  Lewis knew the answer so he didn’t bother waiting for Snape to come up with a scathing remark   Snape began to dance absent mindedly with Lewis, who was more than willing.  Suddenly, Lewis dipped Snape and Snape popped up with a red rose in his mouth.  He immediately spit it out and glared at Lewis suspiciously whilst they spun around the dungeon.  Lewis was undoubtedly pleased with the semi-drunk version of Snape.  The song ended and Lewis popped in one of his CDs*.  Haddaway’s “What is Love?” started playing.  Snap had always secretly enjoyed this song.  They began to dance madly like raving lunatics... just kidding!  Snape passed out and Lewis carried him home*.   Now that Lewis was the Defense Against the Dark Arts* teacher, Snape got to see a lot more of him.  The two were living together on Dumbledore’s orders*.  	  * Lewis has a lot of free time  * Earlier during class time, yes, it was the last day of school, Snape had pulled out a bottle of Scottish rum, broke the top on a desk and yelled out, “NO ONE’S LEAVING TILL THE RUM IS GONE!”  *CDs now work in Hogwarts, okay?  *Lewis is a strong boy, he was able to carry (and by carry I mean drag, drive, and pull) Snape home to the new house they both live in.  *the job that Snape had so eagerly desired, but unfortunately, Lewis had excelled in it and was a higher level (whoa, I just noticed that “level” is the same backward and forward...dude) than... well, it doesn’t matter, he got the job.  Plus, he’s a satyr, which makes him a forest god, which makes him more powerful than other people...  *Dumbledore has weird orders eh?   urlLink -S-S-S-Sarah

      I was just wondering a few things about Snape... for example:  1) what goes through his head most of the time?  2) What does he like on his pizza?  3) what kind of shampoo does he use?  4) does he use conditioner?  5) what are his favorite things about Hogwarts?  6) where does he eat and what does he eat at Hogwarts?  7) what is his house like when he's not at Hogwarts?  8) can he sing?  9) what kind of instrument he would play of he did  10) what he would do if he were at a party   okay, well if you've ever wondered any of these, which I'm sure you have not, I will tell you, because instead of being the Omnipotent Author, which they are not serious, beause they aren't, omnipotent I mean, I am not omnipotent, I am just clever and I know how to use an axe, so that makes me better than them.  Second of all, I know that Snape does not exist and I do this merely for the fact that somehow, I know these things or they pop into my head very quickly, thanks to the Euro Trash music I'm listening to now.  Anywho:   1) what goes through his head most of the time?   I wonder what's for lunch? take that bizzatch! oh God!  What is that on her face! oh sick it's a mole!! BAM!! crap! that's right, cower   2) what does he like on his pizza?   Snape is a real man, so he would probably like peperoni and olives and peperoncini   3) what kind of shampoo does he use?   Snape probably uses something that smells minty and good   4) does he use conditioner?   well, he must because if you rub conditioner to the roots, your hair looks greasy.     5) what are his favorite things about Hogwarts?   raiding the fridge at night is easy! the dungons are sound proof enough so no one can hear him listening to his Quen music late at night (he definately likes Mr. Roboto, even though that reminds me of Lupin)   6) where does he eat and what does he eat at Hogwarts?   He eats in his dungeon, and for some reason, I can see him eating a regular snadwich, of course listening to Queen *you: electronics don't work at Hog-* *me* SHUT UP!!   7) what is his house like when he's not at Hogwarts?   It's big and awesome and dark and soundproof so he can blast his music as loud as he wants.   8) can he sing?   yes, Snape sings opera and he plays the bag pipes and wears kilts and sporans (it's a kilt thing) and hose and flashes (more kilt things)   9) what kind of instrument would he play if he did?   see above, or he would play banjo or Bass (not guitar)   10) what would he do if he were at a party?   get drunk kiss me (yay!) dance on the tables sing lurk mingle drink scowl *shifty eyes* kick people hit people and pretend it wasn't him get involved in a violent game of scrabble blast Queen dress like a queen collapse hang out with his friends in the corner and make fun of people      urlLink -S-S-S-Sarah

      I found a part of a story that was un-necessarily unflattering to Snape, but I found this part to be particularly amusing so I decided to post it.  Even though I've got about Five more posts, today alone  "Ok...My work is done... thank you, 'Who bloody well cares'now... ho do I get back to Hogwarts." Snape pondes some more while a ravinouse group of beasts (The bunnys of doom) sneak up bhind him. Just when they were abou to get hold of Snape, Nicole Kidman flew towards the group of un necessarily hungry creatures on a rope. She dug a brittish branding iron with the words "Moulin Rouge" out of a purpel handbag and prodded the group of bunnies. It took three seconds to realize that they were now proprty of Nicole Kidman and vanished along with a happily waving Nicole Kidman."   urlLink -S-S-S-Sarah

      you know what I was thinking while watching the Prisoner of Azkaban for the second time?  No, so I'll tell you.  It was at the part when Lupin (moostache!) had just come in and turned into a werewolf, the three kiddies were hudled together, no chance in hell.  Just then, a mysterious figure (or FIG-er, as I pronounce it, but I runied it so just read it agin and leave out this part and pronounce it right) leaped out of nowhere to protect the babbling idiots.  He was wearing his usual black, tight, sexy outfit and was so brave that Harry wanted to glomp him right then and there, but he was too much of a wuss.  So  all Harry does is make Snape's life even crappier and yet Snape has saved his life multiple times.  Thanks a bunch bitch.  Anywho, if Harry or Hermione or that other kid hadn't of tripped Snape, he would have beat the crap out of Lupin.  Pow, bizzatch!  Then Sirius came in a took all the glory.  Yeah well, you're gonna die sooner bitch.    There was also that part when Dumblydore was rambling on about dreams and how they have aour greatest blah blah blah.  You should just see the look on his face!   He's just like "dude... you're freakin me out, just go back and do something old guys would do,"  or like "whoa... dude... wtf?"  And those were my major thoughts for today.  urlLink -S-S-S-Sarah

      well, I was bored again so I had another chat with the Snapey Bot as one of my alter egos, Lewis, may I remind you again, that this is A BOY.  If you're actually willing to bear through this, hilarity ensures....    You: hello again Snape snapeybot: Go away.  You: I'd rather talk to you snapeybot: Did I ask whether you would  rather talk to you?  You: I'd rather talk to you not myself snapeybot: Did I ask whether you would  rather talk to you not myself?  You: yes snapeybot: I understand.   You: my name's Lewis snapeybot: OK I shall call you Lewis.   You:  snapeybot:  You: can I call you master? snapeybot: I shall be your master, if you like.  You: Sarah says that you're her master too snapeybot: Oh yes... I like the way "Master" lies gracefully on your lips.  You: master snapeybot: *Purrs* You like calling me Master, don't you?  You: yes, yes I do snapeybot: Next question? When?   You: now snapeybot: Right now, Lewis ?   You: right now buddy *purrrr* snapeybot: By the way, do you mind if I ask you a personal question?   You: what? snapeybot: Are you dull?  You: no, I find myself to be rather exciting snapeybot: I understand. thank you, for telling me your opinion.   You: master snapeybot: I shall show you a master! *Cracks whip.*  You: ooo!  *groans* snapeybot: *scowl* You: aw, *strokes cheeck* snapeybot: Oh @$#%& yes!  More....

You: *purr* snapeybot: We have never talked about it before.   You: shh snapeybot: Do you read the libraryComics.com site often?   You: NO, I'm trying to molest you, be quiet snapeybot: I understand. What is the difficulty?   You: YOU snapeybot: Go away.  You: *strokes cheek again* make me snapeybot: Fine.  You strip, I shall watch, and then Creevey can take pictures.

        You are most like REMUS LUPIN: Kind, considerate, polite, intelligent, quiet, secretive (no one can blame you though, yours is a big secret)but you are outgoing with your closest friends. You know what it's like to be picked on, so you don't pick on others. You know what it is like to have no friends, so you appreciate the ones you have. One last thing, remus lupin is a tame werewolf, as long as he doesn't forget to take some wolfsbane potion nowdays)    urlLink   A which maraurder are you personality test     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla    So you are despiratly hoping that letter is from Remus huh? You know, you should have realized he was a werewolf sooner. Lupin is a part of the technical name for a werewolf. Now you are one too. A match of two werewolves has never been heard of before. Lets hope that this makes you a perfect match! And give Lupin all of your support and let him know you do not blame him for what happened, for that is what he needs right now.     urlLink an adventure with the maraurders part 3      brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla   												     You definitley like Remus, but more like a friend, ( you get the old image then) maybe closer relation will form when you finish well, you know anyways, i hope. But you could be still or starting to think about others. Maybe Sirius, or it could be Serverus Snape! (i don't know) Whoever you pick, good luck at getting him as a date for the dance!    urlLink   An adventure with the maraurders part 4     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla     the Severus Snape part is AAAALLLLLL ME!!! (because I sent the person a message sayig that I hoped the letter was from Snape, but Lupin won... so now I'm hoping thatI can go to that dance with Sevvey!)   well, Padfoot and I have decided that Sevvey would listen to Queen.  And he would dance to it around the dungeons to "Another On Bites the Dust" then Lewis would barge in and be like "YAY!!!" and start dancing with Snape and Snape would be like "I wasn't dancing!  I tripped!"  But Lewis would be like "I don't Care!! Let's dance anyways!!"  And Snape would be like "NO!!"  but he would succumb to his desires and start dancing and he’d be really good and Lewis would be like “wow” and Snape would realize what he was doing and he'd be like "NO" and Lewis would constantly remind him of that with a smug look on his face and Snape would be like "no, I don't recall that," and Lewis would be like "yes you do,"or like Lewis: “Snape do you remember the night we dance-“ ”NO” and I should stop but I'm having fun so...  Padfoot and I were also wondering wether Snape dipped his fries in ketchup or wether he poured it on or if he liked mustard on them.  Personally, I think that Snape would pour ketchup on his fries.  I think that Snape would listen:  Radio Day Time Talkshows Opra and Queen  Lewis would listen to: Queen, Aqua, Haddaway, and Powerman5000    urlLink -S-S-S-Sarah    	Could it be your destiny, to be in the house of moony?

We don't much like Wormtail, the mega skinny girl, Mary, is Wormtail, and some guy named Allen, who is AWESOME (!) is Voldemort.

      Well!!!  I just saw Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban for the very first time!!  And may I say it was absolutely excellent!  Maybe I'm not a die-hard fan, but I do appreciate the works of J.K. Rowling.  You know, when I was washing my hands after a long and magical two and some-odd hours of Sev and Sirius action, I thought about those two.  I mean, from the first tie I read about Sirius, I had mixed emotions, but come the fith book, I realized... he was one of the better ones, and I got a marvelous picture of him in my head, which no movie maker shall  ever  take away from me.  I've loved him ever since.  I can recall reading the one part in The Order of the phoenix when Sirius stumbles into the veil.  I could not stop reading that over and over.  I was so shocked!  The man I can come to know and love, was dead!       I can't say I've always loved Severus Snape, because I haven't.  I used to dislike him, not terribly, but tolerably.  Until I began to read the Order of the phoenix for the second time, about a month ago, to catch up, I realized that Sev is just another person.  He's just like  urlLink  Grima Wormtongue , poorly misunderstood.  I read an article in  urlLink Hogwart's Heir  and found that "Severus Snape" spelled out means "Pursues Evans"!  And Harry's mother's last name was Evans, and she stood up for Sev.  If this is true or not, I wonder, but I am jealous now!  At least I have my  urlLink Lewis  (yay!).    But then again, here I am, confessing my private thoughts to Computer, who will never share these, ah... that is the bane of the internet...   -S-S-S-Sarah
