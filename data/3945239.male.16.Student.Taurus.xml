      I'm feeling better now. A lot better actually. I'm getting together with close friends, have had a relaxing day, and... &nbsp; I just got a puppy and he's absolutely adorable!! I love him so much and he's gotten rid of my bad mood so quickly just because he's so innocent and loves without caring about faults. I'm so glad I have a pet again. It seems like pets are the only things that can truly love someone, becuase it doesn't matter what you look like or what your faults are. I suggest everyone have a pet. It's one of the best things in the world. &nbsp; ~Just a quick uplifting~

      For the first entry- a pissed off person. Fun, yes? Notes: The titles I have are random usually and if they're not and you don't understand, don't ask please. *AND* I  really  don't like saying "fuck" and am trying not to curse as much, but with this family, that seems IMPOSSIBLE.  Okay. This is it. Again. I DESPISE this damn family and can NOT wait to get the hell out of here. Two more fucking years. My whole mood just died and went to hell when my mom and brother came home. My brother's been a fucking brat and my damn parents refuse to admit it's their damn fault because they give him whatever the fuck he wants! So I'm dealing with his whining, squealing and screaming at high-pitched frequencies because my mother's too fucking busy with the mail. And she's already pissed because of something at work, so it's just dandy. Now, she makes dinner and burns the steak so she's pissed off more. I eat, Zach eats, then my parents (my dad had come home) come out of the bedroom from arguing "in private" and eat. I clean up and my dad says to my brother "Don't worry, Sam'll play with you." then gets pissed off that I got pissed off. Gee, why would I be pissed off? Maybe because I don't feel like listening to my brother complain for hours or I have something else to do, or, *gasp* wait now- maybe for the simple fact that he didn't just ASK me!! *gasp...yet again* Imagine that, me being tired of my dad just saying I said something or I'll do something. Now some of you might say "this isn't new; parents don't ask thier kids to do stuff"...well this is where it's my parents fault. My dad used to -always- say please and thank you and ask me to do things. So now that he doesn't, it pisses me off. If he asked, I wouldn't be that bad about it. So I play Crash Bandicoot with Zach for an hour and listen and deal with his shit. He's sent to bed at 9- an hour after he's supposed to be in bed. Now my father starts screaming about how much his life sucks, how my mom is annoying (reasonably so), and goes on a long-ass rant about me. He apparently gets along with me best, but if this is best, I don't wanna be close to him. I've decided to just keep to my damn self. But here are a few points and quotes from the rant:- "she goes out too fucking much"- I "don't do a goddamn thing in this house"- always have an attitude- lately I've been a "lazy bitch"Okay. I'm fucking 16 years old!! Of course I want to go out and have fun! Why? Because later I'll have too many responsibilities! And I do do things around the house!! I love how my cleaning, help watching Zach (because my mom doesn't watch him

      Otakon is coming in 4 days!! And I'm spazzing to make my cosplay costume! It's really weird, but I feel excited like at Christmas...is that sad? Meh. I don't care, I have fun. There isn't much going on besides the excitement for Otakon. So I'm just getting this updated, so the no one that reads it can't say I don't update. XP Wow. Writing to no one. It's weird, writing like this- to no one as if I am talking to someone- is strangely relaxing. Even when it's about nothing. Weird.
