      Ok, in light of the fact that Laverne and Shirley was a spin off of another popular and successful show Happy Days, it has entered my mind that YES there is the possibility of a spinoff being successful.  I have to admit that yes, I love Friends. Is that so wrong?  But Joey with his OWN show? I wasn't so sure...After having a Friendsathon with my roommate, we came to the conclusion that joey is what you would call a "bounce off" actor. He IS funny, but he needs someone to be funny with. He just can't hold his own. (Sorry Joey)  But hey, that girl from the Sopranos will be on it, so maybe things will work out?  Also, I MUST have too much time on my hands since, well...I'm writing about television shows in the middle of the afternoon. I can't help it if I don't feel like doing anything! It's 80 degrees outside!!
