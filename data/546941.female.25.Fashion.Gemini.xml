          Taken from the car when I was going thru the I64 West Bound. The Arch stands tall along the Mississipi river. We can ride the tram to go all the way to the top where we can see the view of st. louis downtown, you can see the black dots at the top..that's where the windows are..and the arch is designed to sway..so you can feel it sways when you're at the top..630 feet above the ground. I went all the way to the top once, squeezing in the small tram with 5 other people..the tram (elevator) is so small you can't even stand..you have to sit your azz down. not recommended for people who are claustropobic.

          Jibran riding his new Johnny Jump Up. At first we wanted to get him a Jumperoo..but that one is huge and taking up so much space..this one suits the need perfectly. He loves to jump up and down on the laps of whoever is holding him..which is pretty tiring (although i can count it as an exercise for my arms..:p) cause he seems to never get tired of that activity and plus he gets bigger and bigger everyday.

          Teh BotoL...one of our fave drinks..we always have it in the fridge, although nothing beats the taste of drinking a cold teh botol from its original bottle in the middle of jakarta's heat...this kind of packaging will do me good for now..=)

      Jibran is a Daddy wannabe..he has to have the same shoes as daddy's..;)      Isn't this just the cutest thing?!       Jibran kecil kecil tapi sepatunya udah banyak dan lucu lucu semua..i'm going to keep all of his shoes..so when he's all grown up later on..he can look at those shoes to remind him how tiny he once was...and also to let him know that he was a stylish baby boy and never had a moment of fashion faux pas...:D

          Taken at the student center (it's the student union for some of the universities) of Southern Illinois University Carbondale..somewhere around Fall 2001. I miss being there..especially during the crowded and hectic lunch hours..I miss sitting in one of the food courts, eating lunch between classes with some of my friends..bitching about the exams and the professors or eating sandwich while skimming the materials for the exam..hehe. I miss my college life.
