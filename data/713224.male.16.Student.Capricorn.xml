           People in your company think you are unreal, they are hallucinating. You are creativly inspiring aswell as you make people delirious and delusional. You make time appear distorted, colours appear brighter, sounds more sharper and things seem to change shape. Sometimes people are frightened by you and get scared of everything. You mess people up, one minute they could be laughing the next they are sobbing. Sometimes you disress people so much they try to commit suicide. When people have spent alot of time with you, they get a 'flashback', they could be on a train comming home from work and suddenly start mocking the bloke next to them who appears to have grown a long hairy snout like a rat.    urlLink Find Out If You Were A Drug, What You Would Be!    quiz by  urlLink ravenritings

      One day, a bird was flying along. It was very cold, and about to fall. As it's wings were weekening, a much larger bird crapped on it. After the bird hit the ground in the warm pile of dung, he was happy and warm. Since he was so delighted in his new home, he began to sing a beautiful song. Then, hearing the song, a fox ran over and took the bird out of its steaming pile of shit, and wiped him off, then proceeded to eat him. Morals of the story: 1)Not everyone who shits on you    is your enemy. 2)Not everyone who gets you out    of shit is your friend. 3)If your happy in the shit, don't    break out in song.

      It was another Payday, and I was tired of being a Mr.Goodbar. So I saw Miss Hershey  standing behind the Powerhouse on the corner of Clark and Fifth Avenue, and I whipped out  my Whopper and whispered, "Hey Sweetart, how'd you like to Krunch on my Big Hunk for a  Hundred Thousand Dollar Bar?" Well, she immediately went down on my Tootsie Roll, and,  Uno, it was like pure Almond Joy. I couldn't help but grab her delicious Mounds 'cause it  was easy to see that this little Twix had the Red Hots. It was all I could do to hold back  a Snicker and a Krackle as my Butterfinger went up her tight little Kit Kat and she started  to scream "Oh Henry, Oh Henry!" Soon she was fondling my Peter Paul and Zagnuts and I knew  it wouldn't be long before I blew my Milkduds clear to Mars and gave her a taste of the old  Milky Way. She asked if I was to M&M, but I said "Hey Chicklet, no kinky stuff". I said  "Look you little Reeces Pieces, don't be a Zero, be a Lifesaver. Why don't you just take  my Whatchamacallit and slip it up your Bit O'Honey?" (and what a piece of Juicyfruit she  was too). She screamed, "Oh, Crackerjack, you're better than the Three Musketeers!" as I  rammed my Ding Dong up her Rocky Road and into her Peanut Butter Cup. Well, I was givin'  it to her Good 'n' Plenty, when all of a sudden... my Starburst. As luck would have it,  she started to grow a bit Chunky and complained of a Wrigley in her stomach. Sure enough,  nine months later, out popped a Baby Ruth.

              Netflix is everything I expected it to be. only one of my discs had a minor scratch problem and the rest were fine. The discs come when netflix says they will and I can expect a very small gap between sending out the old ones and getting the new ones (2 days, one from the outggoing postbox to them and one from them to my mailbox). I also let a few friends add alot of good movies to my queue and cleaned it up again. At this point I would highly recommend netflix to anyone who wants to see some movies or expirement with different genres, or someone like me who lacks digital cable (thus no On-Demand), and who doesn't wanna stop by a movie store all the time to get movies. Netflix also seems like a great thing for me to use at school, always having a wealth of movies to watch at any given time without riding your bike downtown and having the hastle of opening an account at the local video store.

      This was a fabulous movie for anyone to watch. Nothing outrageously funny, though there were some parts that made you kind of huff at it. The whole movie, though, was very entertaining, and when you sat back and looked at the whole picture, you see that its a really cool movie. And the way it is put together really lends to the storytelling plot. I would definately recomend this movie to anyone. I think the movie deserves:    ****  *

There isn't much I can say on the down side other than that it didn't leave me all that entertained, but I didn't feel like watching it was a waste of time, in fact, I would recomend it to anyone looking for a good mystery/drama. In the end I give it:    ****  *

      I saw this movie today going into it with the impression that it was hillarious, but i was kind of disappointed when it was only sort of funny, with no real one-liners which is surprising for any movie with Ben Stiller in it. The movie has a good amount af subtle dark humor, which I love, only this movie didn't make me have too many huffs or grins over its jokes. Part of it might be that I didn't give it much attention, and I watched it with many pauses in between, but I still wouldn't go out of my way to see it again. I give this movie:    ***  **

           I am back from workcamp, and the first thing I did when I came back was to sign up for netflix. The main thing that pushed me over the edge to make a decision was the wealth of fans There is a 2 week free trial where all you have to do is cancel within a 2 week period, and so i decided to take it. I haven't gotten any DVDs yet, because I onlny signed up today, but the first ones on my queue ship on Monday. After about an hour of browsing and getting used to the system, I had 200 DVDs on my queue. I decided to narrow it down, because there is NO WAY i could watch all though movies, so i narrowed it down to 100, which I won't be able to see in the 2 week span, but i'll try and get close.      The browsing works just fine and the adding of the movies works very well, for the most part the recomendations are great, and how I found most of the movies, but some times stray from the catagory, like figure skating olympic finals is produced when i look for recomdendations for a skate video i just added to my queue.  Stay tuned for the next 3 parts of my netflix adventure.

      Now let me start out by saying this is a good cd, and a great deal with the half hour DVD "Specimins of Beauty". Not the best of thier studio efforts, but still a great disc. Thier single is called "The Connection", and is more MTV than most of thier stuff, but still an enjoyable song. At first listen "Undermind", "A Song I Heard the Ocean Sing", and "Crowd Control" really stand out to me along with "The Connection.  What are you doing reading this?

      I have created a little jam track to see what it would be like. It is just the main riff to "Dispatch - Flying Horses". It sounds pretty good and is fun to play with, but I need to buy or borrow a real base or midi keyboard so I can get the base line right, because right now, the baseline was clicked out on a software keyboard, and the timing/velocity is terrible and it really brings down the whole track. I'll make it available for download soon.

       urlLink    This is basically going to be a bunch of premade garage band songs, with sectional repeats in place, so that you can solo in the middle and play guitar kariokee with some good songs (at least thier good in my book). The one I'm starting on is "the Grateful Dead - Turn on your Lovelight". Im not sure if this thing is going to be successful, so once i finish, im going to share the results of Lovelight, and see how it goes. More updates as they come... obviously.

           When I first saw the name of this video game, I thought "Hey, i'de rather get fucked by a pack of angry goats, than play a movie game" Since I live a long way from the nearest farm, i felt obligated to try. As soon as i looked at the box, i also noticed a familiar baldy (no, not ellen degenerise), it was big Vinny D. Now I'm not a huge fan of VD, in fact, my philosophy with his movies is similar to that of movie games ever since -xXx- was released, But since i couldn't get a ride to the local prison, i had no choice but to play it.      This isn't youre average movie game. V Dizzle's voice acringg is just as good as his acting, monotonous and balls to the wall, add his confused and angry stare, and he could tell you wearing womens underwear is hardcore and badass. But this becomes boring when you feel terrified to walk by an item when the Vinmeister barks "Press 'X' to pick up this weapon". You half expect him to take a cheap shot at your mother or make a comment striking my man hood down to that of a 9 year old girl. Now all this slander of a accomplished *cough*failiure*cough* actor (i dont care HOW bad ass he was in Pitch Black) may make you think this game sucks, which it definately doesn't. Actually, now that I think about it, it really isn't that great. For starters the graphics are really good... sort of. The anti-aliasing is terrible, and so are the textures. the animations are averageg though, and the models and attention to level design are superb. Another aspect i like about the visuals in this game is relatively no hud. The guns dont have crosshair and the ammo is displayed digitally on the gun. The only display is the health bars, which are very hard to read and they're ulgly too. Obviously the plot is decent because its a MOVIE, and the game play is alright, but it has NO replay value (which is not something youde want in a 10 hour game).      All in all, my rating is a 5, but if you dont hate Big D, then its 8.5-9.     nice goggles... jackass.

      I'm back again. Now for the part that will make this bloging run different from all the others... staffing. I will have at least 2 more people start posting articles on my site. They are two very devoute gamers, and they are both pretty funny. It should be interesting to see this new version come together. They are not ready to start posting yet because they are still in school with finals coming up, but after my camp (which I go to with one of the kids) I will set them up and show them around blogger, etc. You can probly expect the site to start picking up again in late June/early July. I also have a few projects of my own which im looking forward to because they are now heavily funded (I found a JOB). More about the job and the first of my projects later.

      This movie was fantastic. I think its pretty close to Will's best movie, but it wasn't all him. I think the Daily Show's Steven Cobert stole the show though. He played a very stupid weatherman, and he did it perfectly. This movie had a ton of very funny parts, as shown by the preview, but the begining was very slow. I was also happy to see Ben Stiller cameo, and that Vince Vaughn also had a part. The whole news team (main characters was absolutely stacked, and some parts of the movie i thought i was going to choke i was laughing so hard. I give this movie:    ****  *

      This was a great documentry, period. It was fun to watch and it amazed me again and again seeing all the different aspects of turntablism. It really made we want to go out and buy some turntables. Most of the video was really grainy, but the audio was fine, and thats what it was mostly about. I would recomend this movie to anyone... just anyone who has an hour and a half free. I give it:    *****

      The Perfect Score is just another teen comedy/adventure movie. I still liked it, because it was entertaining, but very cliche. If this made it's way to VH1's movie formula show, it would get thoroughly pwned. It has a breakfast club brat pack of teams, and they all turn into a little bit of each other by the end (oops did i just give away what a  surprise  ending this had?) But in the end, these kind of movies are good if you have nothing else to watch, but this I think is worth going a little out of your way for, giving it:    ****  *

      I finished watching the two season 1 DVDs I got from netflix, and they hilarious. Alot of "Sienfeld-like" moments, probably because Larry, the main writer, producer, and star of the show was the head creator of sienfeld. This is more of a middle-age suburban Sienfeld, which isn't quite as funny, but it makes for new plots, and more awkward situations. All inn all, this new version of sienfeld deserves:    ****  *

      This movie was awesome! it had the two key elements of a good movie: Time traveling, zombie death, comedy, and the most important of the three, explosions. But seriously, this is an outrageous satire that begins where the Evil Dead movies left off. It is a must see with a ton of one liners, which, unfortunately, you had to see the movie to really get. It plays of every major cliche for the whole action genre (and some terror cliches too). This movie is too good for the normal ratings system, so it gets, like 14 stars. Just go out and see it now (make sure to watch itwith friends, because watching with a group of comrads makes it much funnier.    ************

       "I would like to light that person on fire, but they are 15-20 feet away, far out of range of traditional lighters or even those really long matches made for fire places."   The answer to the age old problem is here, in the form of a badass homebrew flamethrower:   This thing is so hardcore, it makes Mr. T cry. It is a beuatiful thing when your neighbor makes his own high powered weapon, and tests it out right in your culdisack. But even better yet, he releases the plans on the internet, so the taliban will be running around like "JIHAD!!!" with a small army of PVC fire-chuckers. Doesn't that make you feel all warm inside?  check out  urlLink this forum post  for more pictures and details.
