      [Future IST Classroom]       I have chosen to envision the future IST classroom because I believe in visions becoming reality! I want my fellow ISTeers (in the near future) to enjoy their multimedia learning to the fullest equipped with the advanced technology, latest softwares, newest gadgets and gizmos. The ones who would sculpt the future of multimedia learning deserve the best of what multimedia has to offer (at least in their time). Thus, harnessing the finest multimedia tools alongside with first-rate instructional methods and bringing about an unforgettable learning experience to the audience.

      [Future IST Classroom]  Let’s assume that the Philippines is no longer a third world country and had become enormously successful over the past years. Mars, on the other hand, had become the planet’s resource for genuine materials. Bagong Pag-asa City is now the new capital of the Philippines, whereas Manila undergoes a special city-treatment, an extensive multifaceted process wherein the city is being cleansed of the different kinds of pollution accumulated over the years. Manila is just one of the many places in the country that is being treated. Finally, the Filipinos stopped bickering the government and instead, started to act on their own for the sake of their country – patriotism has been rising up!       The De La Salle University (main) is situated in Bagong Pag-asa and could now be considered a campus (the grass is greener in this side!). Gokongwei, a.k.a. Planet Gox, is literally a half-planet as it is being housed by a dome of glass (similar to an igloo). The structure has a specialized cooling system designed to respond to different weather conditions. Advanced technology encloses the whole dome. On the ground level, one could find the classrooms for the froshies, the mini canteen and the TeleportStation (please see ‘TeleportStation’ post). The computer laboratories and more classrooms can be found at the second level. The third level was partitioned for majoring students. Each specialization has their own labs and rooms specifically designed for their needs. The Office of the College is at the fourth level, as well as the other offices and conference rooms for thesis defense, etc. Where did the legendary Gox Lobby/Lovvy go, you ask? The underground is the new abode for students who choose to come two hours early for their class to surf the net via LAN cable (like me), for students who have no more class or have really nothing to do. This is the place where flocks of froshies meet up and chat about the beauty of their new school. Also, this place is the witness of CCS hearts meeting and breaking. Of course, there are still agents/DOs who are STILL devoted in terrifying/watching over the students. Going to the highest part of Gox, a satellite system is installed for enhanced communication overseas and conferencing. It also aids the cooling system of the dome. A spectacular view of green pasture is seen through the wall of glass. The myriad of colorful cross-breed flowers and butterflies greet the eyes of techno-stressed students & faculty - thanks to the College of Science!

      [Future IST Classroom]  The students need not to worry about losing their IDs or leaving it at home, simply because it does not exist anymore. The ID System is replaced by the Finger Scanning System (similar to the one used in the movie, Paycheck). The FS system is not only good for identity and entrance needs, it is the key to the students’ My Sputnik account (please see ‘My Sputnik’ post), and the faculty’s FD (please see ‘The FD’ post).

      [Future IST Classroom]  ! – please make sure you’ve read my ‘environment’ post before reading below =]  The IST Classroom can be found in G301 and G302, each has the maximum capacity for 20 students and a Sputnik (please see ‘My Sputnik’ post) for each student while a FD (please see ‘FD’ post) for the faculty. A special feature of this classroom is its movable floor depending on the desired arrangement of the Sputniks and the FD. The Sputniks could be arranged in a circular manner to implement cooperative learning. On the other hand, it could also be in semi-circular position to engage in a panel discussion or for presentation purposes. At one corner of the classroom is the Utility Corner where scanners, printers, LCD projector, and other paraphernalia can be used when needed. Just ask the agent for assistance.

      [Future IST Classroom]  Kiosks are available for students who need access to the Net. If a wireless enabled device (i.e. a laptop) is within the range of the signal coming from the kiosk, it enables the device to have an access to the Internet. Kiosks could be found in all the buildings within the campus. In Gokongwei, there are 3 Kiosks at the center of the underground lobby/GOX lobby, and one at the center of each levels of the dome.

      [Future IST Classroom]  Now that the university is a campus, the next building is expected to be at least 10 meters away. With that, each building has their own TeleportStation for incoming and outgoing people. Similar to an elevator, teleportees will enter a zone that has a capacity of 40 and wait for a few seconds to be teleported to their preferred builing. There are four zones for each TeleportStations, two for incoming and two for outgoing. Each zone sends the teleportees to a specific builiding in a specific time. For example at 8:00 am, Zone 1 teleports teleportees to the Miguel Building while Zone 2 to the LS Building; at 8:05 am, Zone 1 teleports teleportees to St. John Building and Zone 2 to the Yuchengco building.

      [no. 3] Closer relationships between the school and the home through telephone technology, parents and teachers will be able to communicate in virtual time. This may seem to be the simplest form of technology-based communication but from this advent come mobile phones and electronic mail, which bridge the gap between parents and students, as well. I was able to utilize this technology back in high school. My teachers contact me through cellphone and email. One time, my adviser called me past dinner time, looking for a classmate of mine. I think that she (classmate) wasn’t home yet and she’s in trouble. Not knowing her whereabouts, I told my adviser so. I’m guessing I’m not the only one whom the adviser called but whatever the situation is, technology could aid to secure the safety of students. Another teacher of mine emailed me after I got into some trouble. It may seem simple and mushy but those words of encouragement made quite an impact on me - thanks to yahoomail. Another good benefit brought about by communication is instant feedback. A call or email could assure or inform the progress of a student to his/her parent. In the near future, there’s no need for parents to leave their homes/offices just to attend a meeting or appointment. Through networking, video-conferencing and/or, wireless communication, parents could be present in a meeting right at the comfort of their homes. Distance is not a reason for teachers and parents not to interact.  [no. 6] My first exposure to a computer was when I was in Grade 5. My father brought home a laptop and an ENCARTA encyclopedia CD-ROM and some other CDs. I was hesitant at first to use it, like I was technophobic or something, thinking that it was only for geeks… hehe. But then kuya was toying with it while I watched him. He taught me how to navigate through Encarta, and also, how to play the MOTORACER game (one of the CDs). So I did explore around the thing and eventually, I became attached to it. I went through the different applications like WordPad, MS Word, Paint, Solitaire, MS Powerpoint, a little Excel (I didn’t like it because it deals with computations – Math, yuck.) and even Notepad. I became familiar with their use and without me even knowing, as the article put it, I was “information exploring” at home. Basically, most of the things I know about computers are self-taught, the core of home as center of technology-based learning. In terms of home schooling, I know no one who is under that program so I don’t know what it’s like. I’d still prefer the education I have now because I am more exposed to the outside/real world and home schooling seems boring. I would have to disagree that technology based at-home study offers affordable and feasible alternative to public schools because the expenses are really questionable. Electrical, telephone and even Internet bills could rise up and how could that be affordable? And there are various ways in which an individual could learn - not only through a computer.

      Reading through the early part of the book article, I became bias with the role of teachers against the role of technology in education. The first thing that came into my mind was the probability of technology replacing teachers, which the book did mention. It instantly reminded me of my beloved high school teachers. Those are the people who devote their lives in teaching and support their families with their profession and I can’t imagine them unemployed. Yes, unemployment, I believe, would be an alarming issue once technology dominates over human effort, especially here in the Philippines. It was mentioned that there are areas (i.e. rural schools) where teachers are not available or in short supply, more specifically in highly technical subject areas, and their solutions for this is distance learning or networking. This is a case where teachers were not directly replaced but rather supplied in a bi-locational manner through networking. And so my bias reaction eased down. But the problem that could arise in this situation is regarding the school budget – increase in tuition as a result of demand for more resources, technically expensive equipment and administrator.  “…technology-based delivery systems will achieve better results by standardizing instructional methods and decreasing personnel costs.” “…some foresaw technology eventually replacing the teacher as the primary instructional delivery system.” These are quotes from the article that I strongly disagree with for the reasons similar to what I have mentioned above. “When microcomputers placed the power of technology in the hands of teachers, the image of technology shifted from replacing teachers to supplementing and enhancing teacher-based instruction.” “Others feel that teachers and school must remain an important part of the instructional process, but that technology tools will EMPOWER them to teach better and use their time more productively.” These quotes on the other hand, I strongly agree with as I have experienced myself technology enriching my college education. The Internet, itself, plays a major role integrated with devices (laptops, and the like) I commonly use. It focuses more on the educator utilizing technology to the fullest rather that technology taking over. It sounds better because, I believe, it serves the real purpose of technology – to aid, support, enhance and promote efficiency. “Technology resources also will help teachers shift their emphasis from delivering information to facilitating learning.” What I like in this concept is that it gives freedom to students to explore and discover things for themselves rather than simply spoon-feeding information to them. The educators will only guide the learners in the process. I am also in favor of authentic assessment mentioned in the latter part of the text where the assessment an individual’s performance is altered from paper-and-pencil tests to performance-based method and student portfolio – a more improved quantitative and qualitative method of evaluating a student’s progress.  To conclude, which ever method will be used, it is yet to be proven effective. Whether the student learns from a teacher in a classroom or through video-conferencing, what we're really after is the efficiency and the outcome of learning. Do students who video-conferenced perform better than the ones in the classroom with traditional setting? Or did they gain just the same knowledge, only the video-conferencing was a lot expensive. There are still any factors to consider like the economy, school budget, even manpower.

SOLV... next term... next term...   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ SOLV Tonight! - Talk: "When Doves Cry (Sins that hurt the Holy Spirit)" by Cherry Sumang  Galatians 5:13-26   "13 For you were called to freedom, brethren; only do not use your freedom as an opportunity for the flesh, but through love be servants of one another. 14 For the whole law is fulfilled in one word, "You shall love your neighbor as yourself." 15 But if you bite and devour one another take heed that you are not consumed by one another. 16 But I say, walk by the Spirit, and do not gratify the desires of the flesh. 17 For the desires of the flesh are against the Spirit, and the desires of the Spirit are against the flesh; for these are opposed to each other, to prevent you from doing what you would. 18 But if you are led by the Spirit you are not under the law. 19 Now the works of the flesh are plain: fornication, impurity, licentiousness, 20 idolatry, sorcery, enmity, strife, jealousy, anger, selfishness, dissension, party spirit, 21 envy, drunkenness, carousing, and the like. I warn you, as I warned you before, that those who do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God. 22 But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, 23 gentleness, self-control; against such there is no law. 24 And those who belong to Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh with its passions and desires. 25 If we live by the Spirit, let us also walk by the Spirit. 26 Let us have no self-conceit, no provoking of one another, no envy of one another." ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  hmmmm....... it's noisy up here *** pointing at my head ***  the Dreamweaver tutorial will be starting in a few.  signing out.

RELSTWO: surprised? i asked permission from the semi-drunk professor of nina, mark, gen, joan (IT peeps) if i could sit in his class... no prob. the big prob was, the LCD projector was not doin it's job. 3 laptop na yung dumaan sa kanya, even tabetchiii, still... nothing. so they started even without the ppoint while we were configuring the laptops, even ramin came by to help, still nothing. so the group decided to view the video, "The Calling," sa laptop na lang... ditch the LCD and that's not the end yet. even the audio messed up. oh how thing could get better. the external audio was loud enough but the dialogue was barely there... total sabotage. haay... so ang ginawa na lng ni nina is habang nagpplay yung movie, ineexplain nya. sana next tym na magreport cla di na masabotage! kryss didn't make it in class.
