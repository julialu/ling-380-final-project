      Every last man, I think I have been alive busily too, All naver are the best and I'm not the worst but lest I should forget being one. complexly nobody ask me why u live that, not to heard nothing. Our young people lives in a country progressing capitalism and have tried to assert thier rights. any of nations does not has a perfection. Many kinds of dreams, movies arts, sounds and letters attand to come at a pasadise but we r not to live in.  That 's not logical procedure in a computer system and similar to a case of reading one's palm and physiognomy then haing guessed one's charactor.
