      Hoshi wandered about the old mansion searching for her beloved Ukchan. Every footsteps she took picked up tons of dust swirling around her. Coughing she stumbled forward leaning on a wall till the dust cleared. After the dust was settled, Hoshi looked around and spied on a stairs she never noticed before. The girl sensed a strange delight creeping up on her as she made her way up the stars. Something was going to happen, she could tell. At the top of the stairs was a small trap door. Hoshi pushed it open and stepped into the crisp night air. A movement caught her eye as she emerged. Ukchan turned in the full moonlight to see who was there. His body had a crystalline glow around it in the moon as her turned and his short blue hair turned to diamond in Hoshi's eyes. As he spotted her. The deep brown eye of Ukchan drilled right into Hoshi's soul as he stood searching her. The females min and heart told her to run to him, but her body didn't listen. All was still. suddenly Hoshi came into herself and dashed forward, her legs becoming weaker and tears streaming from her eyes. She drew nearer and near when her legs gave out. Hoshi started to fall, fall right into Ukchan's strong arms. Her heart skipped not one, not two, but three beats as Ukchan stopped the fall. She didn't dare move for a moment feeling she might wake from a dream if she did. Ukchan gently wrapped his arms around her and pulled her tight to him. Hoshi help her breath as she buried her face in her soft shirt and linked arms around him. She relaxed when Ukchan;s torso softened and leaned on his chest. Hoshi was in a dream like daze as her worries fell away. Squirming a little in the arms that help her firm yet gentle she looked up and caught Ukchan looking down at her with a small curved smile. She lovingly smiled back at him with teary eyes. Taking then a chance Ukchan leaned down, closing his eyes and met lips with Hoshi in a kiss so heavenly and pure that the world instantly feel away from them. Their bodies grew hot as they shared their warmth and seemed to melt into one another, Hoshi closed her eyes and started to kiss Ukchan back putting slender arms around his neck. Both felt as if they could stay like that forever, but Ukchan pulled back after some seconds. Hoshi opened her eyes and looked at Ukchan with the slighest blush streaking her face. Nothing in the world could have beaten that first kiss.

      ((I hope you don't mind, I continued the story.. add on as well! We could collaborate on it, that would be cool ^^)) Currents of warm air swell and gather underneath your ebony-furred wings, pushing you up, up, higher and higher in a spiraling motion until you think you shall faint from the height. Meaningless patterns of light dance on the inside of your eyes, a fireworks show only for you. You cough. Again and again you try to purge your throat of the sticky-sweet smoke, but it clings to your windpipe like molasses. Your mind starts to becoming weak, driven by the need for clean air it throws its last reserve of energy to your new wings, flapping madly to send you shooting out of the foul, odorous cloud. You break through. There it is- clean air! It seems like a miracle to you as you gleefully inhale the crisp, cold evening atmosphere. But something's not right.. your tongue runs along the top of your mouth before passing along your two canine teeth.. a salty substance trickles from the cut caused by the needle-like point of your tooth. And as the blood flows over your tongue your mind is sent into a frenzy. That was it.. you needed it! Blood! You craved it, you lusted for it, HAD to have it. It was your source of energy.. this newfound realization terrified the corner of your brain still conscious. But soon your mind is captivated by the lusting presence inside of you. Forgetting the forest, forgetting the flames, the corpses, the curse, you beat the air. Wind streams past your face as you cut through the air toward where your instincts told you blood was. Where humans were.. where there would be people to provide you with your means to live.. that is what you longed for. For now, you were not human but a creature of shadow, a vampire..

           Far in the dark night. When all hope is lost. The screech of an owl, the howl of a wolf. You shake as you steep deeper into the forest. The air starts to get colder and yet somehow, more evilly delicious. You come to an ancient clearing showered with sliver from the full moon staring down at it, at you. Your skin prickles and you turn around. Bloody rotting corpses are hanging from each tree. Each body hung from organs strangled around their neck. They seem to be staring right at you. You run! Fast. But nothing could take the curse on you. Nothing will change you back. You start to go though a transformation. Your ears become long and pointed. Your K9 teeth become sharper and longer. As your nails grow great black wings burst the skin on your back.  Screaming in pain you keep running, right into a corpses hanging from a tree. It seems to put it's dead cold arms around you and not let go. Nothing could help you, nothing would save you. You shut your eyes trying to believe nothing is happening, the world is fine, but as soon as your eyes even slightly open you are still being held onto by the corpses. Turning back to the trees trying to break the grip your eyes grow even wider with fear. The whole forest is burning. The sky is alight with dancing flame. The corpses disappears as you try to run the other way only to find that you are blocked in. Trees fall ablaze to the ground starting the grass on fire. You can't get out. You will die and forever this evilly holy land will be your ashes grave. In your vain attempt to escape you leap into the heating air and your wings take flight. Higher and higher into the smoky air that's clogging your lungs.

      Ok so this is the dream I had last night. It is really mushy and stuff and the best non-vampire dream I've ever had! ^^ Beware! Fluffy things included!  Oky so... It's like this: It started In school and stuff, right? Yea there was this ride thing in this building. Some of my friends and I went in it and like it was a conveyer belt with trash on it splitting into to was as it went. The trash goes one way and people go other way. But like we were on it and this really big bog of beer type thing went on it and got stuck with broke the ride so my friends and I just walked and sat watching the movie they were playing in there on this great pull down T.V thing. *Movie unknown*. Yea. Then we left and separated. *later* I went back in and sat down bored watching movie. *Beware! This is where fluffy comes in!* This insanely hot boy comes in and sits right by me! I mean WOW! Short black hair kinda anime style and stuff and eyes and tall and OMG! I can't describe his hotness (and in the dream he is also the person that plays Ukchan). I look at him knowing him and like, I have a crush on him. He looks at me and I look at him and stuff. He says to me in his warm voice type thing, "I've always liked you" And I'm all OMG! I love him! And stuff. And like yea. He takes my hand and like yea. He hold hands there and stuff. I lean on his shoulder. And then like yea soon we get up and like walk out holding hands and stuff and I'm all ^^. I start walking in front of him holding both his hands with both mine leaning back on his chest and stuff. And we are just like walking that ways across the quad. There we meet his friends and he talks to them and stuff and I break away from him to go tell my other friends. And like I find friends and things (Bekka and Annie fer some reason) and I tell them and there just like "No fair!-_-; My Ukchan" and I'm all (^-^)v yea. I go back  and another friend runs up to me and are all like "How did you get Mat? (name of boy)" and I'm all like "I was myself" type thing. And then I go back to him and I spend the rest of the dream in his arms. The End!

      Okay, so I finally had a dream!  It started out.. I'm not quite sure. But it ended up in this farmer's market type of thing, where lots of inventors are selling a whole bunch of junk. So, I'm there for a bit, then I go back to this.. camping.. place. Sort of. There's a barn-ish-shed-thing-of-doom where cars are parked and stuffs like that. And so we're all gathered by this freakin' AWESOME anime guy, looks like Crim from .hack//SIGN only wearing leather.. black leather.. mm.. :9 Anyway. And he's like, in front of this hill, and saying that there's a fire coming our way. A few seconds later, fire comes ROARING over the hill. People are all screaming and running for their cars and all, so we (we being my mother and father and I) hop into an old-style white beetle and get to the road. Then I look over and I'm all "O_O OMIGOSH WHERE'S BOY?" And my mom just turns to me all calm-like and says, "Oh, he must have died."  So I start freaking out, and my parents don't even seem to care. I hop outta the car and race back toward the barn-ish-shed-thing-of-doom, which is on fire. And people are just.. standing in it not caring. -_- So I start shouting, "BOY! BOY! PETER! WHERE ARE YOU?" He just walks out (Point of interest: he's got glasses on in my dream, but normally he's got contacts) calmly and gives me 'that look' that shuts me up pretty fast. So we all get back in the white beetle and are driving down the highway when suddenly the 'rents turn off of the road onto a.. golf course.  We're just drivin' down the golf course when suddenly it becomes a cliff. And at the bottom of the cliff we see.. more golf course. Well, we can't stop ourselves now, we go flying off of the edge, then land. Boy and I crash through the windshield and start.. uh..  flying.  Like we were shot out of a cannon, you know? And the land below us becomes so teeeeeny tiny, and we hit the ground and it doesn't hurt at all. Then we get up to find mum'n dad.. then I woke up.  ...I have the oddest dreams..

      Ok this odd dream has to do with wolvies!!! YAY! Many odd things in here! Funfun!!  So it starts off with me and my brother in my room just sitting when my mother and some random lady person comes in. They sit at a table that is at the foot of my bed in my dream and look at us. We look at them. Mother dear tells us that we re wolves!! And we are all like YAY! ^^ *bouncy bouncy bouncy *! And the lady person is all nice and gives us papers to fill out. Something about mating season. Well like. We don't have time to fill it out and we go to this place. We walk right next door to the old school, but as we are walking it changes to a forest. There we find wolves everywhere! hundreds of wolves! And like, most of them are really thin with their face and body so I change into a beautiful pure black wolf (most of the other wolves were brown) and like I walk down there. Here I look around and see the lovely brown wolf. Not thin like the others and not fat. Just, perfect. I run up to him "Hello? Hi? Heeeelllllooooo?" But before he can answer me some random werewolf in his human form blows a whistle and we all have to line up just like in the old school! Then like, I look for that wolf I was trying to talk to, but I can't find him. After that we went home and got the papers to fill out again. I started to fill it out like my brother, but he finished first (because most of the time he was trying to sit on my paper). When the lady comes back from where ever she was I showed her my paper and she gives me another one after telling my brother to not do that. I try to fill it out again, but for some reason I was not sitting at the table. I soon lay my paper down again just to take a break when my brother comes over and sits on it and tears it. I'm all "grrr" The lady comes in and I show her my paper and shes all "*sigh* I didn't think it would take you THIS long to fill it out." I get the paper and sit at the table and do the second question then look at the first. It says to write your parents and grand parents and great grand parents madden names and I'm all "What the heck? Do we have to do the first one?" and the lady is all "No, you can skip that one." So I do most of the paper before I wake up. OHH! Wasn't that fun? Being a wolf was the best thing I have ever felt. OH! I want a continuation of that dream!!!

      Ok, so last night I had many odd dreams and I will tell you two here. So like yea. This one has pirates and kids in it! On with the dream!!!  It started I was on a huge boat in the middle of an ocean with my mom and like 11 daycare kids. All the daycare kids were like doing this course where they climbed things, crawled on things, and slide down things to nursery music. Then like my mom was wearing a scary red dress. Then after all the daycare kids were done we went down below the deck to uhh.... change into different outfits. Well my mom brought out this patriotic dress and then a really REALLY big american flag. Well I thought it was for twirling like in color guard, but then she took it off the poll and rapped it around my head like a bandana. So I'm like ooook... Then like I went up with five kids and like these pirates started to board our ship. They grabbed the five kids for slaves then wanted more. I tried to fight them but they soon got five more. With these they took out these needles (sowing) and pocked each kid and each one died. One little boy was left. I took him to the front of the boat and told him to stay, but he followed me anyway. I got mad at him but then the pirates took out other needles (doctor) and stabbed him. Then I woke up. Isn't that nice? Well, yeah sure, I mean. The kids are gone now right???

      Picture yourself in a boat on a river, With tangerine trees and marmalade skies Somebody calls you, you answer quite slowly, A girl with kaleidoscope eyes. Cellophane flowers of yellow and green, Towering over your head. Look for the girl with the sun in her eyes, And she’s gone. Lucy in the sky with diamonds. Follow her down to a bridge by a fountain Where rocking horse people eat marshmellow pies, Everyone smiles as you drift past the flowers, That grow so incredibly high. Newspaper taxis appear on the shore, Waiting to take you away. Climb in the back with your head in the clouds, And you’re gone. Lucy in the sky with diamonds, Picture yourself on a train in a station, With plasticine porters with looking glass ties, Suddenly someone is there at the turnstyle, The girl with the kaleidoscope eyes.

      Yup. You guessed it. It's time for me to update all of my Blogs, and I.. DON'T HAVE ANYTHING TO SAY. This is just a waste of your time. Don't bother reading it. It's just a little something I'm putting here to make me feel better. It makes me feel like I actually updated all of the Blogs that I have. So... you can ignore this. Yup. If something interesting pops up, then I'll post it. Yep. So.. if you're still reading this, then you're stupid. Well.. not really stupid. You just have a lot of time on your hands. Am I right? Tell me I'm right. Ah, jeez, I have WAY too much time on MY hands. I'm such a loser. Chibichan Ryu... in your next post, beat some sense into me. Please? x_x;; Love and Peace Out, for now! ^_^;;  ~SDchan Hoshi... neh?

      Okays, I've been getting into the hang of updating all of my zoomyful Blogs at one time, almost every day, so now I'll be posting on here WAY more often. ^_^ Buwahaha.. okay, anyway. Here's a song that we like by... you guessed it! Sarah McLachlan! We loff/lurv her, yush we do. ^_^ She's really good at capturing the mood in her songs. Here you go! "Full of Grace," go download it, OR ELSE!  The winter here's cold, and bitter// it's chilled us to the bone// we haven't seen the sun for weeks// too long too far from home// I feel just like I'm sinking// and I claw for solid ground// I'm pulled down by the undertow// I never thought I could feel so low// oh darkness I feel like letting go//  If all of the strength and all of the courage// come and lift me from this place// I know I could love you much better than this// full of grace// full of grace// my love//  So it's better this way, I said// having seen this place before // where everything we say and do// hurts us all the more// its just that we stayed, too long in the same old sickly skin// I'm pulled down by the undertow// I never thought I could feel so low// oh darkness I feel like letting go//  If all of the strength and all of the courage// come and lift me from this place// I know I could love you much better than this// full of grace// full of grace// my love//  Well... there it is! Read the lyrics, download and listen to the song.. then reflect on this. It's good for your creative thinking. Maybe after deeply thinking and reflecting, you'll even get it. Nah. It's not that easy to understand. Your loss. Tata! ^_^  Love and Peace Out! ~SDchan Hoshi... neh?

      Well, I got some art. Woo woo, yay!   urlLink Nekomori  Part of a trade with  urlLink Sekora , it's her character Nekomori. Just sitting in a tree, chillin'. Haven't colored it yet because I don't know what colors she is (hint hint Sekora..) ^^ The only thing that makes me angry about it is the fact that when I inked it with my crappy cheap pens, the staff got messed up.. but I can fix that when I color it using Photoshop. So, overall.. not horrible.   urlLink Dalisedeni  My fan-made character from the musical CATS, looking rather cute and HAPPY. Deni's a rather HAPPY type of person... cat... Jellicle.. uh, whatever. The main point is that she's HAPPY. Only thing I don't like about this picture is the hand she has balled into a fist, it's just.. uh.. fingers = way screwed up. An' I was trying to make it look like she was holding her arm out straight toward the hypothetical camera. But, uh.. doesn't look like that worked. Either way, though, Deni is HAPPY!!!  ^_____________________^

      ((Just a free-verse poem I wrote a few days ago.. it doesn't rhyme or have any apparent rythm..))   Forever  You are like a beacon to me Your smile, your face, your eyes They call to me They tell of safety, they tell of love Tell me that all I need to do is to get to you To feel whole If I could I would run to you Never leave your side Tell me how to get to you, and I'll come Just tell me when...  Give me half a chance I'll fill you with warmth Just give me the courage I lack I'll stay by you Lead me through the hard times I'll give you all the good All I would ever want in the world Is to be here in your arms- Forever  I see you when I close my eyes It gets me through each day That taunting vision of someone so dear Could it be a sign? I need but to think of you To feel that things will be all right But that emotion isn't good enough I need to hear your voice telling me so before I know it's true I know if I was near you I'd never have to fear Won't you please show me how?  All I need is a word I'd give you all I am Just safeguard my soul for me It will give you the happiness you deserve Tell me it's all right, show me the way I'll make you feel whole day after day You're my breath, my sight, my hope And all I need is you- Forever

      Dark... it was... dark.  But the mottled light that cascaded down from the fissures in the wall, the flecks of light was what made it all okay..  It made it okay to the dragonlet that dozed, hidden from the casual eye by the overhanging rock ledge. She wasn't old per se.. well, not for a dragon at least. Somewhere between two centuries and three, if not three and four was she. But, compared to the rest of the dragon race, she was young. Considered thirteen, at best.. and only then if one was feeling generous.  But the little azure reptilian creature, she was not the proper size...  She was small.  Miniscule.   A runt, which is the name that many of the older dragons gave her. She had been undersized ever since birth. Due to one faulty gene, one gene in her entire body out of the millions housed there, the one faulty gene that had the ability to change her appearance completely. When one her age would be by now roughly the size of a small school bus, she was instead about the size of a house cat.  Size aside, though, she had the looks of a dragon.. blue scales made up armored skin, lethal spikes ripped from the very tip of her nose all the way down the base of her spine to her foot-long, whiplike tail. The two scaly bat-wings that shot out from her shoulder-blades, the span longer than her body itself but right now, folded tight against her back like a tortoise shell. The deft, four fingered hand-like paws, each nimble digit accented by sharpened keratin stakes of claws. The strong back haunches of the creature like loaded springs, feline.. almost. Her mouth, the elongated front canines that protruded from her mouth to give her the look of danger even when asleep, the row of needle-sharp chompers housed within.. Even the lizard eye, golden, ever-searching, now covered by a filmy eyelid as well as the tough outer lid, out of the same material that her skin was.  Yes, she was without a doubt a dragon. It would be nigh impossible to mistake her for anything but, if it were not for her size. One would immediately assume she was instead a fire lizard instead of dragon.. if they were not familiar with the species. One with just a touch of knowledge on the subject would know by the ridge of spikes, the shape of her head that she was indeed dragon.  A Blue Dragon.. the race of dragon most commonly dealing with liquids, with the life-giving substance on this planet.. Water..  ((TBC- to be continued..))

      jinopets.com has some cool looking pets, but not many! It's maps seem a little ill drawn and the games are few, but it also has good chat! Go see!  veropets.com is really odd. It has somewhat of a choice fer pets and you can have 3. The pets seem... odd. They seem mostly to be made from parts of other animals in life. Then the map. Most of the places dont work, but hey, it's a growing site!  furry-paws.com is a very odd sitee. It has nothiing but dogs, lots of dogs. Over 100 to pick from. These are realy life dog breeds. Then, after you find where to get them (It's kind hard to) you can change it's pic. The place has jobs you can chose from and games and stuff. Overall it's on odd oky-ish site.  muchopets.com is really odd. The pets are 3D-ish and moving! That's a new one. There are NO games and the site is confusing. It's a slightly OK site, but I wouldnt tell anyone to join it.

      I went and saw The Bourne Supremecy today with Diane and Amy B. after the three of us stayed at Amy's house for the night.  Pillow fights, projector screens, loud movies, a raid-able pantry, an ELEVATOR(gonna live in it when I'm living on my own), what more could you want?  Oh. The Bourne Supremecy?  Highly  recommended. I'm still unsure if I like it better or worse than the first movie.. It's definitely got more fighting/car chase action scenes. Less of a 'Who Am I' and more of a 'What Am I.' It was fun.. but, uh, good times, good times!

      I think this post pretty much sums up the  very  intriguing RP I had today...  Sasuke~ continued staring off into space until he blinked once, again. Someone was intruding upon his white haze..  his  reality. It blurred, before finally snapping into focus. He was back in the tavern.. he was back in the tavern, and he could hear Kaiuri's words. In disbelief he centered his gaze on the girl who had stuck her face in front of his. He just gaped at her, like he could not comprehend what she was saying. Uselessly his jaw worked up and down, no sound coming forth from his throat. Then he frowned, an angry look coming into his eyes. She was trying to take away  all  of his past... she was trying to wrench his  name  from him.  He would not let her!  "I am Sasuke.." he began, stopped dead by her words. ' I killed you. I ran you through with one of your own guard's weapons! ' "No, I can't have, you don't know.." ' You died that day. I watched your blood spill out like a waterfall cascading over the edge of a cliff. ' "That's not, there's no way.." But hadn't he awoken in a pool of blood, his own? No, it couldn't.. ' I watched you die. ' "You didn't.." ' I watched you take your last, shuddering breath of life. ' It can't have been.. ' I was there, you cannot trick me. I know you're not him. You're not Sasuke.. ' These words, and the rest, echoed in his skull haphazardly, each as if a separate voice shouting at him. "No, no, no...!" His forehead was touched by her hand. ' You are dead and I am alive! ' All her words between when she touched the spot where her kiss had landed years ago and when she declared that he was dead, had disappeared like the middle of his life. Just clouded by that white haze. Even before Kaiuri had finished condemning him to hell Sasuke was on his feet, the stool he had been sitting on knocked over in his anger. "Shut up!" he burst out almost childishly. Normally his shoulders were hunched, as if Sasuke just wanted to go unnoticed. But now, in all his fury, he was at his full six feet and eight inches, towering over Kai. "Just shut up! You don't know, you can't, I'm not dead! Can't you see? I'm not dead! You never killed me, I don't even  know  you! I don't know anyone, I don't.." his voice was dissolving into helplessness. "I'm not dead, I can't be, I can't.. I can't!"  But hadn't he awoken in puddle of blood..? Didn't this girl's presence cause him to fade into the white haze again? But he wasn't dead... was he?

      I went again today, so sue me. Partly because I wanted to go again, partly because I had a friend who wanted to go but under no circumstances would go by herself.. eenh. *mutterwhine*  Back on topic. So me, dad, and my friend Amy B. went. We also manage to drag along Boy, which made me happy. We get there, get tickets, go downstairs to wander. Wander wander. I'm the only person there who's been there before, and similarly I'm the only person there who actually will speak their own opinion. -_ NEVER  has an opinion anyway. *siiiigh* Off-track again

      I'm not sure why I continue to post, when I doubt people actually bother to read it. e_e; I guess it's just the way I am. I like to log things, so that at later dates I can look back on these records and say 'Hey! I did that!'.. yadda yadda, you know. Oh well.. it makes me happy, I suppose.  Well, yesterday was the Comicon. It was my first time going and, needless to say, I  loved  it. I would've stayed longer than I did but.. I think the friend I went with was getting bored.. she's not as into anime as I am, although considers herself an anime artist.. enh, very confusing. Anyway, so we (we, being my dad, Katrina, and I) got there when the doors opened, but had to go get tickets. Noo problemo. So, we've got our tickets, dad leaves us with a cell phone to go wander around. Finally we find our way downstairs, to the exhibit hall. Wow, what can I say about the exhibit hall.. it's HUGE! And  VERY  busy. So, Katrina and I start to wander the booths.  First purchase: A deck of Cowboy Bebop playing cards Cost: $5  Although the cards are starting to scare me with a few of their pictures. (If you're over at my house, ask me to show you what I mean..) So tomorrow since I'm going again I'm planning to get the Princess Mononoke set, just to be safe. XD So, more wandering. Swag, free stuff, = happy Bekka. I get a free painting in traditional- Chinese, I think it was -art style, with bold brush strokes. FREE! I love it.  Second purchase: The collected Tall Tails volumes 1-3, just because the furries are cute, and Egoraven because according to Daphne Lage there's only 25 copies out Cost: $15  This was pretty much a feel-good purchase. I liked the art, I had money, I bought it. Nothing really special to it. So, we wander on a bit more, and come across a LotR booth selling authentic-looking elven knives. Katrina just HAS to get one, 'cos she's such a LotR nut. I HAVE to spot her 11 bucks, 'cos she's low on cash. e_e;; But I don't really mind, so long as I get paid back. I mean, the knife is really awesome. XD Wander down to the other end of the convention hall, by now my bag is STUFFED with swag. Which made for a very happy Bekka ^_^ Apparently we missed the Megatokyo store the first time, so we figure out its number and go to visit it.  Third purchase: Megatokyo 'ph34r t3h cute ones' poster, autographed by Fred, Sarah, and Dom. Cost: $14  This is probably the thing I loved most. I mean, AUTOGRAPHED! Besides, I've been wanting the poster. What better time to get it? I was seriously considering getting Boy a shirt, because I'm a nice l'il sister, but- c'mon. Nineteen BUCKS?! I'm not THAT nice! So I didn't get him anything. ^_____^  Got lunch, ate lunch, went upstairs to watch anime until around 3, when Katrina wanted to leave. I had a complete and total AWESOME time. Seriously guys, it was so fun. There was even someone cosplaying Tsukasa (with paper mache staff and everything!), and two old ladies as Vash and Inuyasha! (I might add, Inuyasha had toilet paper stuck to his/her sandal..

      Trip report from Arrowbear.  Arrowbear . Arrowbear Music Camp. Woohoo!  11 days up in a pile of sticks, near Arrowhead & Big Bear. Thus the name. I'll try to keep my report short, but then again I've got a lot to say.. and I want to be able to read this at some later date and remember all the cool stuff. So, well... if it doesn't interest you, you don't have to read it. Also- it's like, near impossible for me to put all that I want to say in any coherent order, AND I have forgotten days for many of these things. So.. uh. Good luck!  -~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-   Day 1, Wednesday - Arrival. The place looks so foreign! It's really crowded, near impossible to park. While mum dear registers Katrina and I, we go find a bunk. Main dorm- no luck. So, down a flight of stairs to a little porch with bunks placed on it. No luck, so down a bit further to the.. pile of sticks! A cabin on the porch, in the minimalist sense of the word. Rectangular cutout for a door, square cutouts for windows with loose screens on them.. except for one. Guess who gets the top bunk where they can be assaulted by mosquitos flying in through the open window? Mmmhm. Me. Katrina's on the bottom bunk. So, we dump our junk, audition, and get to know the people there. There's four bunk beds in the cabin (not room for anything else

      You know..  I really wish that I was the kind of person that had so much to say. Like, the type of things that really matter.. the types of things that would get somebody to really think hard, to start reflecting on their inner self and all of that good crap.  Well, you know what?  I'm not.  And that's what makes me so.. so angry at myself. No, I'm not a very deep person! Or, at least, I don't show it or know it if I am.. I'm so unsure of myself. I'll think, "Oh. I realize that I'm not deep. That must make me deep. But wait.. Maybe everyone realizes this, and I just don't know it? That would mean I am in reality shallow. Or maybe all deep people think they're shallow and have the same thought process as I.." It's just.. going in circles. Does that mean that there's something wrong with me? Or does everyone think like this? Am I just trying to fool myself into thinking that I'm better than I really am?  Maybe it's just that I worry too much about these things. But lately I've felt sort of numb inside. Maybe I'm not getting enough sleep, and it's making me hallucinate that I have depth to myself.. or maybe I really am becoming apathic? Is it my tired brain trying to confuse me even further? Well.. I don't know. I just don't know. But, I'm so.. so..  Dull. Empty. I'm like a shell, although I bet I'm not and just wishing I was. At least then I might be at least slightly interesting as a person.  Is it that I think that people actually care about things like this? No, I don't think they do. I'm just whining about my lack of thought like the stereotypical Livejournaler..  *sighs..*  Am I really that shallow?

      Soo. Yesterday I went to the mall with Anneh, bought a ton of crapola (and Tarot cards!), stayed up 'till about 3 am.. 4 am? Ennnh.. whatever. Spent a long time on the subject of 'food' (XD still hungry, eh glutton? well, there's a seafood place, maybe you should- *falls asleep*) and also came up with a rather amusing thing concerning X-men.  Bekka: You know that part in X-men? Where, like, Mystique sticks metal into guy's butt? Anneh: He has... buns of steel!  Crude due to tired-ness... none the less hilarious XD  And, meh, deepness in general. ^_^ Thhheeeen I came home, got haircut (It's.. SHORT! *dies*) and basically lived life. Yannow?  On a completely unrelated note, I am about as angry as can be... for reasons... not at anyone who'd actually bother to read my blog, don't worry XP But... Well,  some one knows what I'm talking about.... *patience snaps* Grmmm... they don't... get it... Damn Fuzznuckers..  ~Ryume Of course, you know,  this  means  war !

      Explaining my 'mysterious' almost two day disappearance:  Thursday I was banned from the computer. Yeah, nothing special there... 'tho I want to post about my day, because I  can .  Um, so, pretty much a friend comes over- Problems there, I was being such a bitch, but then again.. so was she.. and um vv;; Gonna have to apologize, anyway -then it's my lesson. After my lesson I go shopping for a one-piece swimsuit but end up getting this classy jacket for formal occasions and a white shirt to go under it, because.. um.. low neckline grrmm grmm guh. I also get a black tank top, because I  can .  Come home, time for Bekka to act domestic. -_-;; Cooking almond roca (carmel covered in chocolate and almonds- YUM), in an APRON. XD It... amused me, no I don't know why. But... APRON! :6 So, yeah.. too bad I don't actually get to eat the almond roca

      Well, I suppose I never really had been quite content with Sasuke's  urlLink original picture  (NOTE: Not my art. A link to where I got it from is coming, don't worry), so I went back to the site I got it from for two reasons. 1, I needed to find out if he was from a story or anime. (Point of interest: He's just a created character namd Alex, apparently) 2, I wanted to see what else the site had, because I was just scanning the place when I found the first picture. So, I was off to the  urlLink art gallery  of  urlLink BakaNeko  to see what I could find.  And I wasn't disappointed!  I stumbled across a  urlLink very interesting picture . (Again: Not my art) The character on the left caught my eye. It was promising, but there were two problems. The colors, and the other person in the picture. But he had the right shape to his face, and his clothes were right as well. Big problem? Well, I could always try and rely on the general populace of short-attention span roleplayers to read my profile once it came. But.. you know, people don't  do  that these days. They just look at the picture. So, it was steadily becoming more of a problem. But I can be  stubborn  when I want to be.  So what I did was dragged the picture into my trusty version of Photoshop. Short while later I came out with what I wanted.  urlLink Success!  It's still awaiting the final 'OK' from the owner of the character Sasuke, but.. I dunno.. I think it's better than the one I had in the beginning. Much more 'Sasuke' to it.  But pretty much all I'm trying to say here is that Photoshop Is God.

      1) I got a picture finally. T'is Nyamo. I like Nyamo. Nyamo is very cool. Nyamo Nyamo Nyamo. Don't you like Nyamo? I do. ^-^  2) I need to take a poll. Am I the ONLY one who enjoys summer? o_O; All of my friends are like all "I can't wait for school to start" and "Sssssoooo bored"! T'be poifectally plain I love summer to bits and wish it was longer

      Last night I did something I don't normally do. I turned off the computer early, even before Boy did, and went to go beat that  one level  on Tetris Attack. And because it amuses me, I shall relate to you the (mis)adventures of Bekka and the Super Nintendo.  So anyway, this level is the last one of the Stage Clear mode, where you beat levels one by one as they get progressively faster. Not hard, really. Well, that is, the levels leading
