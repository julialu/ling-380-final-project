      G4 will be with us.  if it happens the natural way today, great.  if not, it's happening tomorrow with the aid of modern medicine.  photos of the golden child will be posted right here for the world's viewing play-zure.  10-4.  dad.

      we're gonna have that baby.  shari's doctor visit yielded a thursday 8/19 date to induce if she hasn't had the baby the natural way.  although her OB said, "I think I'll see you before Thursday".  there IS a light at the end of this tunnel.

      shari's contractions actually subsided after the walk.  she has a doctors appointment today.  hopefully they schedule a day to induce her if we don't have this baby the natural way...SOON!

      maddie got home today.  had a great time with her grandparents and her cousins in colorado.  nice break for us too; but we're so glad to have her back.  now that everyone's back home, shari can have this baby without worrying about somebody missing the blessed event.  had dinner at denny & judi's and shari was having small contractions.  could be something.  she's taking a walk as i write this.  maybe it will happen soon.

      ok, it's saturday and still no baby. no contractions even.  shari is disappointed; but i still think something will happen soon. madison is on her way home from colorado, so everyone will be here when this baby does decide to make his/her grand entrance.

      no baby news yet. shari called me at work yesterday afternoon and told me to come home, she wasn't feeling well; but by the time i got home things had subsided and she was fine.  have to admit....i thought yesterday was going to be the day.  oh well....
