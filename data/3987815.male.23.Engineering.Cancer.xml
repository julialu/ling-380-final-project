      I wish all the 53 young virtusans a grand success in their projects  Last&nbsp;7 weeks of training has been exciting and we learned a lot of technical stuff  and earned a lot of buddies  So let&nbsp;us show the same spirit in our new experiences and show all of them that  First&nbsp;training Batch of Chennai ATC really made a Difference...........&nbsp;
