      So I have this summer job that is part time and the person who works during the day has an excuse for everything so she can get out of work and enjoy the sun.  It seems that she has had a hard shake at life and she always complains about her illnesses.  Everytime I come into work, she uses me as a sounding board to dump all of her problems on and in a way I feel bad for her, but then there are times when I just want to hide from her. Anywho...enough about my boring job! Today is the first day to vote in Canada!  I am very excited about this years election.  I encourage everyone to vote!

      Okay so this is my first "Blog", but I can assure you that this is not my first time voicing my ideas and concerns about life.  Here are some facts about me, I go to the University of Toronto, I study Art History, I have a love/hate relationship with Toronto, I am in constant search for friends, I love Aquarius', I love Architects and Engineers, I wish to be an Architect...that is only if UofT grants me to be accepted to the MA Architecture program.  I love to dance, I started dancing when I was three, I love to get into my own little world when dancing to house or techno.  I'm a Libra, so I am very sexual, creative, diplomatic and balanced in life.  I like to "party", but I also like to be serious and relax with friends or a good book.    Check out my website: http://individual.utoronto.ca/fourthdimension/ My site is a very brief description of why I am interested in the fourth dimension.    I believe my life cannot be clearly defined, I live a unprescribed and free world even though people around this conservative city try to hold free individuals down!  Hehehe, that is my beef with Toronto, I can't stand the in your face "bling", snobbery and self-centredness of this city that could offer so much more.  I look to Montreal as a model for Canadian cities or Vancouver.  Okay I must stop this rant...later.
