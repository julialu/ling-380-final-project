      k, i was just going to add this on to my last post, but i dont know how...so i am forced to make a new one. anyway, i was just clicking on ppl with my same interests, and there is a huge overlap with the other interests listed...(i.e. one girl had the same book as a favorite as me, the sight; she also had evanescence as a favorite band and LOTR as a favorite movie) its a small thing, but interesting...dammit i sound like a total geek. i guess ive becoming one, what with my toe being dead so for the last few days most have my life has been spent on the computer. i think i can even type faster...  i wish i was at comic con. :(

      having nothing better to do, i'm just going to ramble on here for as long as possible. lets see, today i: *read everyones xangas on my list thing *read collins blog *read imps blog *read jons blog *read  World of Wonders  for a while. quite an excellent book, though u wouldnt think it from the cover. *ate a bagel *read neil gaimans blog *hobbled around for a bit to make sure my toe is really getting better and i really can go to comic con *decided that whether or not it hurts, i'm fucking going to comic con tomorrow. there is no way i'm waiting an entire year *sorted some laundry, then got bored and stopped asteriks are interesting, arent they

      I made a blog so i can comment on other ppls without forgetting to leave my name, or for imps, so i can comment on it period. funness. weeeeeeee! maybe i'll even go to comic con today AND tomorrow, even though its already started. laaaaa.&nbsp;titles always sound stupid. i wish i didnt have to post it. the other reason i made it is so i can make jon make me a cool link thing to go on other ppls blogs and ill feel happy and important.
