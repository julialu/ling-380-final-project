      Man, what a fun night last night.  Well, perhaps that's the wrong way to phrase it - spending 9 hours in an ER is not quite "fun", but when you're the staff instead of the patient it is a bit different.  Got to do quite a bit, from basics like changing bed sheets and transporting patients to helping suture and clean lacerations to having to restrain patients and even got to administer a 3-lead ECG.   Part of me wished we'd seen a little bit more, maybe a serious MVC or at least a CPR, but the rest of me is glad we didn't. I really can't wish that on anyone so that I have the chance to practice.  But, at the same time, the only reason I wish I could see one now is so that once I'm not a student, and am out in the field, I will be better prepared as to how to handle the situation.  Ah well, I have all the time in the world to learn...

        Rock on, you're a Ravenclaw! Intelligent, level-headed, and mysterious, you can often be found in the library, studying. You are smart and get the best grades in your class. In fact, you probably got all Outstandings on your O.W.L.s! Your house is respectable and has a good Quidditch team. The founder of your house was Rowena Ravenclaw. Go Eagles!

Great movie... the series is really maturing well on film.  The cinematography particularly emphasized the darker turn of the plot line.  Casting was great, I really enjoyed Gary Oldman and Emma Thompson's roles.   *sigh*  I know I'm 12 years too old, but watching these movies makes me wish the MY invitation to Hogwarts would show up!  =P  In other news, I got a letter today from the National Dean's List inviting me to be listed.  Hurray!  Between that and Phi Beta Kappa, I shouldn't have as many problems getting financial aid and scholarships as I was worried I would have.  Also just got back my results from EMT-B class - got an A in both the lecture and the skills testing portions.  Now just have clincial rotations to do, and I can take the National Registry.  I should be able to sit for the test in July, depending on how long paperwork takes, so I should get my certification and be ready to get a job with an ambulance service or in an ER by September at the latest.  Now, if only I could find a job to last until then... luckily, Starbucks looks hopeful and if not I've got apps in at several other places.  I guess I'll just keep my fingers crossed and try to relax over the weekend...

      Well, I took my national registry exam for national and state licensing as an EMT-B.  The test itself wasn't too hard - no surprises, nothing I hadn't seen before.  The waiting, however, is brutal - 2-3 weeks before I get any results!
