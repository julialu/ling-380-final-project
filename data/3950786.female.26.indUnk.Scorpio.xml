        I never felt alone, I was happy on my own.&nbsp; And who would ever know there was something missing.&nbsp;&nbsp;I guess I didn't see the possibility.&nbsp; It was waiting all the time but it never crossed my mind till you opened up my eyes.&nbsp;  Now all I think about is you in my life, in my dreams, in my heart I know it's true that I belong with you.&nbsp;  Because of you in my world, in my arms, I have everything and now I can't imagine what I'd do...without you  &nbsp;  I never thought that love could be such a curiosity.&nbsp; What attracted you to me was so unexpected.&nbsp; But it was waiting all the time and it never crossed my mind until you opened up my eyes.
