      Today I got the result of the examination. The recent feeling of me is indescribable. Recalling the terrible accident happenend on 23th of May that I missed an exam which is one of my best module (C++), I really feel joyful that I can overcome the difficult position. I reached the overall requirement of getting a MSc degree with only 7 of 8 modules. I want to share my happiness to all my friends and I wish those friends who fail in the examination can breakthrough the predicament. The final job is to do the dissertation and the project well.

      Today another boring but busy day in Edinburgh, 17:50 1th of June, when I stuck with fining out the title of the blog,I lighted up my favorite cigarette" MildSeven" as usual. There came out a question "Why can't I use the cigarette name as the title?" That's a stupid reason I chose the brand name of my favorite cigarette as the title. I tried several times to give up smoking, but I failed. I think maybe "MildSeven" will accompany with me during my hole life. Damn..that is the miserable thing.
