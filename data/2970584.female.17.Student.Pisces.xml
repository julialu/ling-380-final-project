And all the girlies say I'm pretty fly for a white guy. Uno, dos, tres, quatro, cinco, cinco, seis.  You know it's kind of hard just to get along today. Our subject isn't cool but he fakes it anyway. He may not have a clue, and he may not have style, But everything he lacks, well he makes up in denial.  So don't debate,a player straight. You know he really doesn't get it anyway. Gotta play the field, and keep it real. For you no way, for you no way. So if you don't rate, just overcompensate, At least you'll know you can always go on Ricki Lake. The world needs wannabe's, So hey, hey do that brand new thing.  Give it to me baby, uh huh, uh huh! Give it to me baby, uh huh, uh huh! Give it to me baby, uh huh, uh huh! And all the girlies say I'm pretty fly (for a white guy).  He needs some cool tunes, not just any will suffice, But they didn't have Ice Cube so he bought Vanilla Ice. Now cruising in his Pinto he sees homies as he pass, But if he looks twice they're gonna kick his lily ass.  So don't debate,a player straight. You know he really doesn't get it anyway. Gotta play the field, and keep it real. For you no way, for you no way. So if you don't rate, just overcompensate, At least you'll know you can always go on Ricki Lake. The world loves wannabes, So hey, hey do that brand new thing.  Now he's getting a tattoo, yeah, he's gettin' ink done. He asked for a "13" but they drew a "31." Friends say he's trying too hard and he's not quite hip, But in his own mind, he's the, he's the dopest trip.  Give it to me baby, uh huh, uh huh! Give it to me baby, uh huh, uh huh!
