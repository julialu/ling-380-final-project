       Yeah so today so far has been pretty funky. I saw Melissa she was looking nice :D. Yeah shes under alot of stress and said right now isn't a good time but said she would tell me when. To some that might sound demanding but to me it wasn't. It's kool to know where things stand and from this you can just relax a bit more.  I had an interesting time playing pool in the Lees' house (in their new "games" room) was funky I beat James at pool by 1 rack to nil. If only I had been betting! So yeah thats kool. Today I plan on getting my homework done as usual and getting my portfolio back up.   So yeah for now, bye bye.

       Well today was interesting so far. Firstly I got alot of work done on Simple Forums on the main site, forums and advertising company for it. That was alot of work to be doing! The advertising company offers some bare cheap advertising and i suggest people take a look.  urlLink Simple Forums Advertising   I spent most of the day in as i wasn't up for going out anywhere apart from taking the dog for a walk. Just yesterday I think, I spoke to Melissa and we were talking I had to go and said by in Spanish. :D Then she said "wait Luke" , "were u going to ask me out at cell?" and I said yes and in a panic said i have to go now and said bye. She said bye. So now im scared of seeing her 2morrow if i do see her, as i dont know what she is thinking right now. Normally i have sophie down the phone at me telling me everything but she seems to of gone quiet since she found out i was going to ask out Melissa, as she likes me and she wasn't talking to me much last time i saw her.   Life is a muddle just got to live it XD  I hope to get the Luke Dyson site back up with a new layout soon :) To all who are wondering why they ended up in my blog when they visited  urlLink http://lukedyson.com !

       Yah just 10 days of skool left wo0t!    In physics we watched a video about how NASA's first "human landing" on the moon could be a fake, it kept crossing over from agreeing and dis-agreeing and in the end it went round in circles it bored me to hell and it was boiling hot. Maths coursework also bored me!  WEll today was house waterpolo. We won 3-2 i scored 2 of them :) Shame i wasnt there for the first match!

Simple Forums is going v.well i have had v.good response so far! ^.^

       Well the whole thing between me and fabby, I think is concluded. Well I told her on the fone some of the stuff I said in the email and some more. She was a little stunned and we left it there and said goodnight, this was Mon. Tuesday I said she can ignore it it, she was like" but..." and i just carried on. I still like her and all but i think our friendship as best mates is more important. I don't like thinking about girls as "icons" or "trophies" if you see what I mean.  Skool today was interesting. House ater polo we won, i think. House six-a-side cricket we won even thou we never finished. So yeah funny.   SimpleForums.net my first release of Simple Forums, has been undertaking changes the test board is becoming more and more complicated!  So yeah, it would also be nice to get a few "Comments" :)

       I love you fabby!   I just sent her the following email:   """"""""""""  Ok I'm about to shit everything up for you, so sorry. =(   I know that you might of found someone else or you are really angry at me but i wanted you to know I still love you. Night and day im still thinking about you and trying not to cry. I love you more now than ever before, and for this im sorry. I might have been angry in that txt ages ago, but i didnt mean it! Your a lovely person and i was just under stress. But i sorted my life out back then. I have never wanted to break up for you and my love for you never did go down but only up. I just wanted you to know this and maybe somewhere you may find room to forgive me for saying this.  Please still talk to me.  Love You, Luke xxxx   """"""""   So yeah I still love her, and dont understand why she wanted to stop "seeing" each other. Skuse said this was sweet but we both know what ever the outcome is if she says yes or no i will still be dead lol as she hates being made a fuss of, or stuff brought for her etc XD

       Well met up with the Rudwick group yesterday (sat) was fun and all but u dont know how much i cried when i got home, i miss fabby so much and i wish she would know that, but im too scared to say, that i might ruin everything! Yeah so my mood is pretty bad.   With my work i decided to give up with the internet im sick and tired of people messing with me, its got to stop some time. So yeah where my life goes next I don't know. I'm thinking if moving to Antartica where no one can find me. And i can die in the cold.

       Well yeah pretty terrible week.     Got Dumped by my girlfriend for something I did not do! It's well unfair and well I don't want to make a fuss because I'm not like that I'll just let it all go. Even if it is eating at my head 24/7 right now. EVEN through my whole maths exam.    I was going to be seeing her 2morrow for a friends party. But now i don't think i'll go, its too odd. I spoke to Annabel about it today, not out of choice, and she was so bitchy she deserves a fucking big slap.     So yeah life can suck but im ready to move on....       The subject of suicide is an interesteding one btw....

       Spent the whole of lunch with Clodagh and Josh today :) Yeah it was an exciting time wondering around having a bit of a chat. I introduced them both and they seem to get on well which is kool. ^.^  We offered that he should come this Thursday to the Cell Group ( church youth group ) as we were having a BBQ then, it would be a chance to get to know some guys. Thanks to Clodagh for being around it would never of come up if I didn't have someone to talk to who knew about it!   We ended up being later for the afternoon as we never heard the bell! Was a laugh and a bit of fun.  House Assemblies - Yeah what a laugh! I'm up for badmington singles, waterpolo, basketball and cricket. Frist part of cricket was today! We lost i think, i'm not sure i lost interest in the game after a while !  After school I kicked back with Raz and Josh to woolworths. We got 3 cokes and walked off down the street. We met Richard West who left our class halfway through this year at his bus stop. WE then moved on towards the station when i heard someone yelling out my name. "LUKE" i heard! WTF? i wodnered who it was now. And hey it was Leah from cell with her friend Katey (sp?). We spoke for like 2 hours about stuff. Was a laugh and then i walked part way home with her. Walked home feeling kinda "hot" in a temperature wise way :p   Got home and got tired did some french h/w and realised i had 3 weeks 4 days left of skool wo0t! ^.^ I really must keep up with the guys in the summer hols! Should be jokes.....
