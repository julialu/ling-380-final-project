      i just want to make it offical my comic is being "published" on miker's blog i think that it is quite funny. I also have become a member of miker's blog so for a while things might slow down in the fight against errol. you can link to mine and miker's and kovier's comic on a link below.   urlLink http://theoryofpeople.blogspot.com/  it's good.......... i guess that wacky ethan is up to it again in:  urlLink http://www.ctrlaltdel-online.com

      I have heard roumors of a halo 2 demo coming out this month and if we go with the  urlLink www.ilovebees.com  count down it would put it around the 24th. while reading the offical xbox magazine i noticed they were putting out two issues in the month of august one coming out around the begging of the month on coming out towards the end around the 24th. Now i'm no big city lawyer but i do know that the offical xbox magazine usually puts demos out with it's issues so perhaps halo 2 demo on the next xbox magazine. lets hope so.

      i have to say the miker should change his nickname to milk. I am willing to bet that more people will vote for milk. vote milk  screw you run on sentences, i would make fun of inability to spell. and my run on sentences are to protest for change in puntuation  The offical votes will be counted on the 15th so get out there and vote. tommorow is the last day until it is offical.  so as the 15th has come and gone i can offically say that micheal kerr's new nickname is now milk by a vote of:  milk has 4 votes miker has 0 votes

      yup. i've been feeling ill, so the comics been backordered (like my bass).   anyways, here's kov's new comic. if i'm awake later tonight, i'll make one to put up.  so till then... hold on people!

      yes, yes, yes... i know there is a horribly large amount of typo's in the past comics that kovier and i made and were only recently put up on this blog page, but luckily, you all get the general idea.  anyways, that's it for kovier's comic.  i'm almost possitive i got them all (if not, kovier will destroy me).  the only comic i left out by kovier was 'Zblade,' and that's because that was an inside joke at ThaSpY.com/forums at the time.... well, more like an inside insult, but anyways, kovier got his point across and burned Zblade. if you looked at the comic now, it's imposible to understand since ThaSpY.com is no longer in existance.  besides that, kovier DOES have a new comic. i DONT.  i'll post kovier's new comic a bit later, it'll give you all a chance to look at the history.

      alright, that's the last of the stick comic series... for now.  in hopes to move away from writing comics about my friends and i, i shall stop writing comics about my friends and i (heh) and concentrate more on the stick comics. i find the stick comics more rewarding, anyways.  with the other comics (which perhaps i'll repost, somewhere along the line), i copied and pasted way too much.  at least with these i try to redraw them (lies).  well, at least i maneuver the stick people's actions more.  anyways, i'm gonna wait till 12:00 hits to post kovier's comic series (and man is it gonna be a fekkin' lot) just so that our comics aren't all jumbled in one confusing post.  which reminds me, the stick series havent had a set idea for really, execpt for the two phone booth comics.  it's supposed to go, 'Cut the Lines' and then 'Phonebooth 2: The Return' but unfortunately i got one stuck in between.  which is okay.  anywho... that's it. for the moment.

      okay.  so i named the blog, theory of people.  why?  i dunno.  maybe because the people in our comics are true and accurate depictions of how people really act?  hahaha, or maybe it's just a theory?  anyways, anyways, since people are usually in the comics we make, it made sense (no it didnt).  thank you blogger, for existing.  now hopefully kov and i can get these comics workin again. ~miker
