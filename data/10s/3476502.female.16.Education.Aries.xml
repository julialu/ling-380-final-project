      Music: Before I'm Dead - Kidneythieves Mood: Happy ***********************  Today, I fixed my curtains so it'll be dark in my room...! It's really helped my room stay cold...! I'm watching Queen of the Damned right now... it's a great movie! I have the Soundtrack playing in the background...! It's at the Concert scene... I like the one before it, it's very emotional!  It's going to rain all night... which I'm glad... I love the rain, it helps me sleep...!  Ugg, my mom found cigarette butts outside on the porch, and she thought it was me for a while, but I didn't want to tell her it was Evans!! Because she would tell his mom and there would be problems! I told her to let me handle it... because she finally forced it out of me... I told her that it would be simpler if I took care of it, so that was I can make up lies and scare him... like it'll shrink his penis!  Hahahaha, I'm funny!  ::hears wind blowing and rain hitting the window:: OOO! IT'S BEGINNING! I HAVE TO GO TO A RAIN SPELL! I'm going to try to make it last a while! w00t!   Love all!!

       Music:  Veridis Quo - Daft Punk  Mood:  too tired to sleep!  *************************************   Blah, I just got done watching 'Grace Under Fire'... doom...  I just smoked about half a pack of cigarettes... -.-... now I'm buzzed... and it's sad because they were Ultra-lights... but that's all my mom smokes! So, that's all I can get my hands on! Lucky me, I get old woman cigarettes...!  I hate trying to loose weight... I'm trying to get thin so I can wear all sorts of gothic clothes without having to look like a fucking retard... right now I wear baggy clothes and stuff... I hate all those fat girls who wear all the tight gothic clothes...! It's gross... and annoying... because only the skinny goths should be allowed to wear the tight nylon pants...

      Music: I'm with Stupid - Static X Mood: Blah **********************  O.o... I don't know why I feel this way...   I might be able to get some money for some clothes and such... but the thing is... I'd have to go to Austin for a few weeks...! It's for my Aunt Dawn... she'd let me work at her company for a few weeks so I can get some money, because I don't have a car, I can't get a job, and I wont be able to get a car until we sell the house, and who knows how long that'll take!! But if I go, it'll be fun! I think... O.o... ofcourse every time I've been in Austin, I was with my mom, and had to do what they wanted, now I can do what I want...! And her house is so fucking awsome!!!! If I could find the picks I took of it last time I was there, I would post 'em! It is so beautiful! It's a two story Spanish custom! Tile floors everywhere! And it's in the hillcountry of Austin! It's so cool!   I would fly up there probably... that way it would only take 20 minutes...!  Why does my mom insist of opening my blinds and curtains?? "Your room is too dark!!!" so I go and close all the curtains and blinds in the whole house...! I've gotten back into my 'Nocturnal' stages... I've watched the sunset everyday for a week now...! Now it's just boring...

      Music: Veridis Quo - Daft Punk Mood: bored outta my mind and headache **********************  Well, I got bored... so I put some more blue dye in my hair... I found it in one of my drawers in my bathroom... I let it sit for about 4 hours, then washed out the last bits of it, and it left my hair extremely blue for about an hour... then when I blowdryed it, it went to a more milder blue.   I pulled out my skirts and put them on, just because I wanted to...  I look all cool and 'art-sy' right now, I have my bangs hanging down with my hair pulled back in two spiky pigtail-bun thingys, and I'm wearing my oversized black and white striped button shirt with my long bellowing skirt on. Dooom! If I were wearing makeup, I could be an artist.. lol...!  Later today I have to go to my grandparents house for Fathers day... I'll just sit upstairs on the computer all day, while the rest of the cousins play in the pool... unless Marcus and Ethan go... but I hope Ethan doesn't go... because he just talks about weed... and it's annoying. Since I've quit that (3 months so far! Whooo!)shit... maybe Marcus will tell me how he managed to get a STD...

      Music: Digital Love - Daft Punk Mood: peaceful *********************  Watching the sunset this morning helped me not be so angry... also this cute little kitten walked up to me and played with me... I dangled some ribbon infront of him and he played with it. He was so cute and cuddly, but I heard a meow and he ran off down the street. It was like a great dream... heh... I havn't had a dream in years... I've only had nightmares...  I've decided I'm going to see how long I can go with out sleep...! I've only had 7 hours of sleep from yesterday... and it's not like I'm doing alot of over time of... anything!   I need a shower...

      Music: Some dark song... I donno the name or who sings it... Mood: tired...!! ***********************  Well, yesterday I had to go to Nikki's 15th birthday party... I've been to every one ever since I've known her! Well, she got the DVD of all the Guns and Roses Music Videos...! So ofcourse she watched it all night long...! Brittany and I talked about my relegion(wicca)... she said she thought it was interesting, but too complicated for her to do...!   We did this fainting thing that I used to do all the time... You bend over and breathe really heavy until you feel faint, then you stand up straight real fast and someone has to clinch your mouth and nose shut and make you faint. Then they tell you things and you start seeing it and freak out, or what ever... they told me that I was beating up this girl (Donna) and they said that I tried to get up...! I told them that if I stood up to try and wake me up or run and hide...!
