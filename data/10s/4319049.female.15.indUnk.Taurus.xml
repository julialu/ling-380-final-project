      Any ideas for a band name? Cellar Door is already taken by some other band, and quite frankly I'm a bit tired of it. It doesn't really fit the "punk rock polka" thing I'm aiming for.  Post ideas por favor.

      The band as of now still requires:  ~A Bass Player (Hannah? Maybe? PLEASE?!?!?!?!) ~A Drummer ~A Lead Singer ~An Accordion Player (Maryanne maybe? I guess it would be kinda similar to the piano, eh?)  If you already play an instrument or are thinking about taking up one of these instruments (or singing) PLEASE speak up NOW!

      Here's the scoop on the band that never was and probably never will be:  Previously called Cellar Door (from the movie Donnie Darko), the band was established by Maryanne and I. She would play keyboard and I would play guitar. We still required a bass player, drummer, and lead singer of course. We quickly recruited Hannah as second guitar and maybe the lead singer and soon realized that this arrangement was not the best because we still needed many members to complete the group. The plan was to switch Maryanne to bass but that never really worked out. With no lead singer, bass player, or drummer we basically gave up on the band entirely.  However, this summer sparked an idea that started out as a joke but began to really make sense to me. I told a friend that I was going to put together a band that mixes the simplicity of the old 70's punk movement with the original sound of the accordion. Certainly the new style of music that I called "punk rock polka" sounded absurd and funny at first, but it really grew on me. As I listened to my Ramones CDs I began to imagine how well an accordion would blend with that music. So now begins my mission to form a band once again with a completely different kind of sound.  Anyone interested? Anyone care?
