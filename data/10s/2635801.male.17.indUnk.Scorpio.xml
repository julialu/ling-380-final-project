      that was awful. I go through too much to stay cool with you guys. Taking Timm ass in the face takes a lot of balls not to run home and hang myself. I Love you.

      I gestured Jackie over to me to make out at a wedding we went to on Friday and I let a huge, I mean huge fucking burp combined with Scotch and Miller Light.  It was funny until she punched me in the eye and it stayed half shut all night.  Ask L-MO Joey about the time I put my bare but cheeks on his face and farted while he was sleeping in my studio.

Anywho,  Shin-dig my place tomorrow 3-7 (pretty sure it's going past 7 but it made the rents happy) call or whatever 277-2741  roar

      sick? you've met me what, once? if that?  to be completely honest.. i don't even know who the hell you are.  yeah.. you're "sick" too. it's fair of me to say that considering i have no idea who you are or what you look like or what you like to do or where you go to school or work, etc, etc.  it sure is.

      i'd rather be someone who's playing for the first time in a few years and can pull off a simple song than someone who plays all the time and can't keep up with a poorly written guitar melody.  p.s.- no one blame me for starting an arguement when all i was doing is offering up some criticism. maybe i don't play drums often enough to be amazing, but i sure as hell know when a band sucks at their timing. not to mention the vocals making my ears bleed. fact is, you guys need about 7 years of practice. talk to timm. i don't like the kid but at least he and his band(s) can play/sing.

      I could swing by sometime and re write the blogger code.  I haven't done it since High School but I'm sure it wouldn't take more than a few hours and running a few cracks.

      WELL no offence.. but this coming from someone that tries to play drums? you can't even make a decent beat.. my ears were ringing from the noise.. but hey.. you can practice on your stack of books and ice cream bucket. you mite get better? rite? laugh.  much love. xoxo. Jon Sobie

      no offense here either.. because this is honest criticism.. but you guys could be good if you worked on your timing and like.. got singing lessons. lots of singing lessons.

      I'm frightened.  I wish we could post picture icons next to each blog.  There's too many people out there with the same god damn names.
