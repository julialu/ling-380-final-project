						   So  , here I am in the Drama City, aka D.C., and my teacher asks me, "Matthew, what do you want to be when you grow up?" So, I thought about things I loved to do, and came up with music. I told her and she said, "Well when ya famous, hook me up kid." I felt a confidence that yes I can rap and make music. So I started spittin' around some of the people I ride Metro(DC's clean Subway) with. They started spittin' as well. Friendships were made, and I am considered a high figure in the rap game around my school (Which is very competitive). Then, I decided, why not make a group? Next thing you know, I have made 4 hours worth of songs without anyone but myself, but I still have a group name. Dis blog is to show you what happens when I recruit, and the uphill battle of a rapper who has messages and solutions from and for the world and how he plans to find other rebels to join his cause.
