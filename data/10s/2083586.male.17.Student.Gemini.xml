I have rocky and pat (L) to help but i need yours! It's time to rise up and serve your country. Tell me any ideas. So far we think we're gonna get chritmas lights and put them in the shape of a 'B' on the top of my car ;-) oh yea! You Know It! YOU KNOW IT!  -mike

      Ok. My life is a lil on the boring side, but crazy stuff still happens...kinda strange stuff even. As of right this second stuff is good, I have my friends, my music, my bed, my lady friend, and my blog. Simple as that. Sorta. What to say...What to say... I dunno I'm not good at talking "Me and words aren't goodly." (HA! tell me what movie that's from and i'll be surprized).  Well as far as my music goes, I listen to it I play it and I try to write it. Most of my attempts at wrinting fail, but I have two good ones. I'm not in a band, but I'm involved in a little side project with Austin, we're called Music in the AM, we have one song...kinda sad but we've only met to write and play under that name once so it's cool. I really want to convince Austin that we should get people to play with us and play at battle of the bands, but I don't think he'll do it. I'm looking to join or start a new band but as of yet I've been rather unsuccessful, so if you have any leads call me or IM me.  Fun stuff I guess. Well I'm gonna check out, I'll see you around I guess.                                                                                                                   -mike

      hmmmmmmm spring break a time of much coolness i guess. just saw eternal sunshine of the spotless mind, it was good infact it was for sure teh best movie i've seen all year tied with chasing amy. it probably will hold it's title til i see kill bill v2. truth be told im actually very bored so if at anytime durring break you wanna do soemthing just call me or im me or whatever.  i need a date, so if you would like to go on a date with me just tell me and i shall be happy to do so. relationships are very complicated and sometimes i get the feeling that i'm not clear headed enough to handle one but then again if i was clear headed enough were would the challenge be? so in coclussion don't do drugs, don't try to hurt somone on purpose, and stay in school, and you'll be fine or atleast not dead.  -mike

      being grounded seriously sucks. no comp and no hanging with friends...oh i have seen hell and it blows.  my thoughts on being grounded: i spent most of this weekend in my room listening to deathmeatl alone in my room.....pretty scary stuff man....crazy stuff...next time i'm grounded maybe i'll listen to something less likely to make me want to cut myself (jk).

Well as afr as stuff goes i can't complain, although i haven't as of yet found a band, aside from the one with jeff. (don't get me wrong, i will love the band with jeff and kc, but i would also like to get involved in a band that might play some of the qotsa songs im interested in).  no gf as of yet, although there are some really good prospects, idk if im all that interested in having another gf for while, or atleast til after prom. i know some way im going to get tricked into going...damnit.  that's really about it i guess, im kinda bored.  -mike

      down load of the day: 'drain you' by if you don't know i'll kick you in the face and then make you figure it out.  I feel sorry for that little fire hydrant all alone out side in the cold. I bet he misses my trunk. yeah...he probably does. anyway, this weekend was probably better then my whole spring break. lol white castle. lol those drinks were really old. lol 3 hours of sleep. lol good times. damnit i'm really geting sick of the phrase lol. it seriously needs to die, thus i shall stop using it for good. maybe i'll just use ha ha ha or something stupid and pointless like that.

      ok saturday was fun i guess. a quick sum up if anyone out there cares. concert was pretty cool, lots of solos, i'd like to say ill do one next year, but im pretty lazy so probably not. after the concert we were talking to people outside and got traped putting stools away. lost her in the crowd, no big deal she was going out with a few friends afterwards so i just came home.  now i have an ap us project to do from start to finish in one day. i think i did this to myself last time but atleast i had some research done, and of course this time i don't. here's my plan: research write/copy-ish paper then make a huge timeline and a poster with topics from the paper. it should be as boring if not more boring then my last one. but my last one i got a 60/50 for teaching him something. i tihnk mr. gunka thinks i'm a neat guy, sometimes he talks to me about stuff after school or b4 school. mostly bc i know more about history and politics then a let on and he knows that. it sucks knowing stuff against ur will, damn u father for being a politician, and damn u politcs bc i know somehow im going to get invovled.....shit  -mike

09,May,2004


    
       
      ha wow. well things have become ok i suppose. i don't know if i really want to talk about this in a public blog...but i suppose i don't really care that much. ok, so i was thinking of mayby going on a few dates with ash and see how things worked, i even asked her out at prom and at the time she said sure. but she seems really happy with some guy friend of her's, whom she isn't dating. i personnally think they should. yeah well yeah.  spoken: I don’t even know what I’m doing here Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  Little girl walking down the street Godverdomme*, you gotta be with me Well I know, you know Everybody everyone let’s go  Oh, baby, baby, you’re so sweet Ah, ah, wooo  Het leven is hard, de mensen worden bang** I’m so old, you’re so young I know, you know Everybody everyone let’s go  Oh, baby, baby, you’re so sweet Goddamn, ah, ah, whoa  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  Ik denk van ja, maar nee*** Little girl, listen what I say You know, I know Everybody everyone let’s go Oh, baby, baby, you’re so sweet Whoooo Ah, baby, baby, you’re so sweet Goddamn, ah, ah, whoa!   *'Godverdomme' = 'Goddamn' (Dutch) **'Het leven is hard, de mensen worden bang' = 'life is hard, people are getting scared' (Dutch) ***'Ik denk van ja, maar nee' = 'I'm thinking yes, but no' (Dutch)

      ok guys wow... prom was really really really cool. it was just wow. hmmm well i can't really say anything else except for it was really fun, mostly because my head's spinning from being tired and i'm confused about some things, but it's the good kind of confusion, the kind that keeps you from making a mistake (if that last part made any sense im proud of you). well i can't think of anything else except to say it was probably the most fun i've ever had in a long long time.  -mike

      yay for not updating!!! well i guess there's a lot to say. &nbsp; choir camp was great. lots of fun blah blah blah. im kinda sad it was my first and last one. maybe if im still around when im older ill keep in touch and try to be one of the adults there, that'd be sweet...but i doubt it'll happen. &nbsp; the thing with sarah's going well. slow but great. aside from that i wont say anything else. &nbsp; well i guess that's it.

      I was watching High Fidelity for like the 159th time and i actually made a top five rescording artist list for myslef.  5. Miranda Sound 4. Hot Hot Heat & Guster (i didn't want to kick Miranda Sound off the list by taking hours and making a decision between the two) 3. The Red Light Sting (i only have one of their singles but i love it...a bit too much) 2. =W=eezer 1. Queens of the Stone Age...i dont fucking care what any of you say. They're great but i cant stand the songs "No One Knows" and "Go with the Flow" b/c you people ruined them!!!
