      Oh F.  That was some fucked up dream. Great now I'm crying. Literally in fucking tears over some fucking dream. It was just super terrifying. 17, no job, pregnant with motherfucking triplets!  Triplets!!  Madt's on some trip about thinking they're his, even though we've never fucked and he thinks we're going to get back together.    Kids are born, they age 5 years in 1 day. And they're all [suprise suprise] Chinese. They're so adorable, they have the prettiest long black straight hair and huge black eyes. Two boys and a girl.  Oh god they were beautiful. But it was so goddamn scary. Maybe this is my head's way of telling me I'm not ready for the whole sex thing. No matter how much I want it, I'm just not ready.   It's true, LOvE does make you dumb.  Bah. I'm trying so hard. So godamned hard.  Maybe I should just get everything out of my system. Just maybe, hopefully I'll feel better then and I can move on with it.  God I love Chris.  Maybe I'll just go drown now.        Love, love will tear us apart...again.

      I'm supposed to write to Art, I don't think I will.  Oh fucking well.  Josh's bday's coming up! I'm thinking Doors Tshirt and a pack of Kool-Aid should suffice...I mean rock.  My cousin Alex too, her's is Aug. 6...maybe something pink from Limited Too...that means I'll have to go in there and actually buy something

      I'm listening to Adema. I forgot how much I liked them, but I don't as much as I used to. . This is pre-teen music. The lyrics are super literal, they sound a bit like Emo. The Ataris meet Korn...sorry Jonathan xD.   Chris knows me inside out, he knows what a girl I am. He knows I'm phony but he still loves me, or at least I think so...or at least I hope so. He says he does. Things are easy to say. I say a lot of things, many of which I don't mean.  It's sad really. I'm a posterchild for the Anti Phonies Association, but I'm so fake myself. So boisterous. I make scenes to make sure people notice me and I talk loudly about things that have shock value. I LOvE it when people react to what I have to say. LOvE it when they find out I'm Bi, and they get totally grossed out or super intrigued. I'm a flirt, a super big bad flirt. I want what I can't have. I'm two faced and I double cross.  I pretend to like people. I get crushes on boys much younger than me.  I'm a sucker for:

      Chris hates me. He doesn't really love me. He just thinks he can't get anyone better than me, he thinks he can't do better. He's so wrong. I wish he would understand just how wonderful he is.  How very talented, witty, and funny he is. ... He just told me he kissed another girl. That just fucking tore me apart...it hurts a little more than terribly. I've been good...for once. And this is what I get, oh well...I guess it's just punishment for what I did to Madt. Which, by the way..wasn't as bad as what he did to me. He slept with my best friend while I was sitting at home on my birthday, lonely, MISERABLE. When I went out with Wyman, ad did nothing with him might I add, he ranted and raved to everyone. Made me out to be the most horrible girl in history. Everyone fucking abandoned me because I hurt little Madt's feelings. A couple years later he goes and fucks my best friend and I'm not ALLOWED to say anything to anyone. He guilt trips me, he makes ME feel bad because I made HIM feel bad. Well fuck him. He wants me to suffer when I fuck up, he should suffer when he fucks up just the same. GOD. I fucking hate him. I do I FUCKING HATE HIM.  It just hurts so bad you know? It hurts like ...horrible. I'm done. I'm probably going to go carve things into my arm or something.

      I'm new to Blogger.com    I have several others...none that I keep up really, except for my LiveJournal.    Yes, so I'm determined to keep this as anonymous as I can. I'm not showing my Email address, or even giving out my real name.  This Blog is just for me to let out everything that I hold back from my Lj, I don't like to hold things back...so this is where I'll express them.    Still, I'm uneasy...what if somehow, someway someone I know gets a hold of this?  It would shatter me. All my thoughts and private feelings would be revealed to the world and I'd be left out in the cold, helpless to an endless string of drama that would ensue after the discovery of all my little secrets.    So I'm afraid that I'll have to substitue all names and places...just to ensure my physical safety and the emotional safety of those involved.      Yes, well that is all for now I'm afraid.  I must go and make some memories to put in this blasted thing.  Farewell.
