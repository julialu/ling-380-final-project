And I will let you go out on Friday and Saturday.   Sister:    Mom that not fair! I am never around, and if I am, I am never with you.   Mom:    Thats why you need to stay home and spend time with us.   Sister:    THATS NOT FAIR! ERRRRR   Mom:    Well I don't care   Sister:    ERRRAAAA! (stomping up the stairs*)

       Stoopid jocks!   I was driving down the road in my car with my dad, and came to a stop sign. Put the car in first and slowly pulled the clutch out and began to move. As soon as i got to 4000 rpm, and about to shift, i saw some jocks playing basketball on the side of the road. I hit the gas a little harder and got to about 7200 rpm almost red lining it. The car was screaming so loud the jocks looked at me with this "face" ;8) LOL that was so funny!
