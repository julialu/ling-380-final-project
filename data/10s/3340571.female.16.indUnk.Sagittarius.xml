        Last night I couldn't sleep. It just drives me nuts. I felt disgusting about everything we ppl do. all the cloths i was wearing all the un-natural stuff around me. ewerything we have is created on the cost of destroying this world.   yea eaven the pants you wear are bad for the inviorment, they're made in a big industry. and what does a big industry mean? it means more stuff for us but it means allso that we have to robb the nature. i mean what do we do for the nature? something good? hardly. Something bad? ouver 79000000000 times a day, for like 24/7.   no don't get me wrong i am not a greeny. but it's a fact and what can i do when i have to think about it.   to get some profit(that means good life for us), we have big fields or wegetables. but we make the ground unfruitable by getting too mutch out of it. then we kill al the bugs on the fiels so that we could get more. but they only want to live too.     we go hunting moustly for our own fun, to seem as a "man" or just to look cool, yea yea sometimes we do it for good meat. but we have enough meat in our fridgges. don't you? go and check!   the population of many animals is getting lower. and no not 'couse they can't take it up with the "choise of nature" or just have too mutch natural enemis. They die 'couse we are sourrounding them, they can't escape bast us. if they would try it they would be shooten, hitten by a car, what so ever. so now they have to live with theyr enemis side to side like "best palls"- a dad bringing naber *bored woice' wahuuuu!   and the adictions. we croup them as adictions as bad and good. for example my adiction to cigarets- they say it's bad. and i can't let louse of it- i like it... the only thing i have left. but could YOU let louse of your life as it is? i mean the lifestyle- your car, the TV, the electricity, ect.   Yea yea i know it's boring what i'm writing here. but these are facts.   i felt really crazy last night about that. only thinking about that. sad about it. digusted about it.   oh how i wish i could be on the countryside where my home is. i'd like to be alone again. these beatyful moments i have went through. you can't see the breath taking beauty what sourrounds you. i can.    oh how i wish to be a normal, ignorant girl. i know it's stupid what i'm talking but who da fucked up shit cares?   i guess the whole lonelyness thing has made me crazy. but maybe not? i have allways thought too mutch. lol maybe i really need hlp, but i guess they would only write me anti-depresants again. bretty good stuff- makes you sleepry, you don't care about a shit and you look like a doll or flesh and blood.   apropo flesh and blood. i feel like ripping my skin down. everything seems to spinn around. this whole fucking world.    ok if i haven't updated it for 2 weeks then you should know that this world drowe me nuts and i couldn't stand it nomore and jumped down from the 9th floor.   AYEA NOW EVERYONE IS CARED COUSE I AM CRAZY

        Well first of all i want to warn you ppl who are reading this-my spelling sucks like a teethless granny on her spagetty.    Today was so boring. I was at work and i had nothing to do expect for listening to Linkin Park on my CD player. Which actually is forbidden, 'vouse we can't hear the clients. But why the fuck do i have to listen tothe old grandma's and grandpa's stupid talk when i can just make an interested face.
