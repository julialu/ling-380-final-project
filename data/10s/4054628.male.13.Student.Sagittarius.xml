      i thin the hobbit is a truly fascinating book i has taken me a while to read it but i really enjoyed it Ms Cassidy has but in a lot of hard work to get alll this work done and she deserves a good holiday the hobbit is a really good fanstasy and science fiction book it has a great deal of suspense and is enjoyable to read

       my fav character is Elrond, because he's kool.  he's wise and is a great warrior.  if i were Bilbo, i would want Elrond on my side.  Im right and ur wrong.

       So far, i think that The Hobbit is an interesting story but that the author used too many complicated sentences. Sometimes the sentences are too wordy.  There is suspense, the characters are clever and I'm right and you're wrong.

         My Favourite character was Gandalf because he brings alot of magic into   the story which is rly interesting. I also liked most of the characters because i could get an insite into them .

       I thought that all the characters from the Hobbit were clearly discribed.  Gandalf is my favourite character because he is a wizard, he helps the group when they are in trouble.  I also like Bilbo because he is the main character and that he is the hero.

      Now that everyone is online we can get started!   Firstly, remember I expect at least one post a week from each of you.  There will be commendations for the best posts, so get thinking.  My last post suggested that you all tell me something about your favourite character in the book.  I'm looking forward to hearing what you all think.  Secondly, You may have noticed that some posts have been removed from the blog.  These were posts I considered irrelevant or not detailed enough.  If you have a criticism of the Hobbit (for example, if you thought it was crap!) make sure you give me reasons.  Whenever you talk about a text it is important to back up your points with evidence.  Every opinion is valid as long as you can back it up!   IMPORTANT     Make sure when you are writing a post you use full sentences with proper punctuation.  This is not a "chat" room, but a place where I want you to write your ideas formally for the class to read and respond to.  So let's get posting!

      um the  hobbit  i think starts   of slow gets better then slows down again. my favorite character is actually i dont think i have a favorite character thoe they are all pritty detailed characters. if i had to choose a favorite character it would be proberly be  Gollum.  i think gollum is a vital character to the story. the hobbit started to get better when gollum entered the story.

      I think we've established that a lot of the class found The Hobbit boring!   I'm glad to see  some of you took the time to tell me  why  you found it boring as well.  I agree that JRR Tolkien uses a lot of descriptive language and I can understand that you might get bogged down in detail in some sections.  Try to remember though, that using language like that is a way of establishing a realistic "other" world.  It's a way of making the whole place (Middle Earth) seem more realistic to the reader.   The descriptions that JRR Tolkien give us in his work are also the basis from which Peter Jackson created the visuals in his films - if he hadn't described the environment so carefully the films might not have been so beautiful!  What did everyone think of the characters?  Who was your favourite character in the book and why?  (remember you can choose from  all  the characters, good and bad!)

      it is pretty descriptive but that was the style of writing wen it was writen like 50 years ago. if u actually bother to read the boring stuff carefully u can get a good image in ur head of wats going on, just needs some good imagination

      The hobbit was pretty good i was a bit slow at the start but it was really good during the middle.  i can see why ppl say that is slow to dicriptive but if you get past that its pretty good!

      this was alright but too detailed, it was exciting at some points, maybe in chapter 4 with the trolls and stuff but otherwise i found myself reading the same lines over and over again because it was either too descriptive or boring orrrelevent or weird writing style.

       the hobbit was ok. it took a while to get into the book but   at about the 3rd chapter it started to get interesting. i think that the author was a bit too descriptive at the start but it was good to describe everything clearly when bilbo and the dwarfs were stealing the treasure.

      this book is bad, it is too detailed. and too long and too hard to understand if u are reading it, sometimes i end up reading the same lines over and over because its weird writing and i dont get it.
