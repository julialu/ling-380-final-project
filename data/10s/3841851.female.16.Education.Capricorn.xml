						    We judge ourselves by what we feel capable of doing, while others judge us by what we have already done.

						    No matter how big or soft or warm your bed is, you still have to get out of it

						    This thing that we call 'failure' is not the falling down, but the staying down.

						    If at first you don't succeed, find out if the loser gets anything.

						    Experience is a hard teacher because she gives the test first, the lesson afterwards.

						    Good judgment comes from experience, and experience comes from bad judgment.

						    Education is a progressive discovery of our own ignorance.

						    Education is when you read the fine print. Experience is what you get if you don't.

						    Education's purpose is to replace an empty mind with an open one.

						    Last night I dreamed I ate a ten-pound marshmallow, and when I woke up the pillow was gone.

						    What is defeat? Nothing but education; nothing but the first step to something better.

						    There are two ways to slide easily through life; to believe everything or to doubt everything. Both ways save us from thinking.

						    The self is not something ready-made, but something in continuous formation through choice of action.

						    A timid person is frightened before a danger, a coward during the time, and a courageous person afterward.  

						


04,July,2004


						
						    Courage is the art of being the only one who knows you're scared to death.

						    Hard work spotlights the character of people: some turn up their sleeves, some turn up their noses, and some don't turn up at all.

						    Character cannot be developed in ease and quiet. Only through experience of trial and suffering can the soul be strengthened, ambition inspired, and success achieved.    

						


04,July,2004


						
						    Character is like a tree and reputation like its shadow. The shadow is what we think of it; the tree is the real thing.

						    Reading is sometimes an ingenious device for avoiding thought.

						    They always say time changes things, but you actually have to change them yourself.

						    Always read stuff that will make you look good if you die in the middle of it.

						    Perhaps the most valuable result of all education is the ability to make yourself do the thing you have to do, when it ought to be done, whether you like it or not; it is the first lesson that ought to be learned; and however early a man's training begins, it is probably the last lesson that he learns thoroughly.

						    We make a living by what we get, we make a life by what we give.

						    In prosperity our friends know us; in adversity we know our friends.

						    The supreme irony of life is that hardly anyone gets out of it alive.  

						


04,July,2004


						
						    The life which is unexamined is not worth living.

						    'be who you are, and say what you feel, because those who mind don't matter, and those who matter don't mind.'

						    I rent everything, other than the gift of life itself, which was given to me without any predictable lease, a gift that can be withdrawn at any time.
