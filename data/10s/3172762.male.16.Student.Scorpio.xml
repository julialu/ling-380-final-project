      and as I take the last step out of that majestic valley a single tear rolls down my cheek  for I know that the magnificent and wonderful things contained within the bussum of this hidden corner of the globe will forever not remain a secret  for man, iron, and smoke; greedy for all things pure to be consumed; will destroy it in their confused and power-hungry rage  It will be whiped of all things good and displayed as a joke to the world; a mockery of it's original self  but as I stand there and see faint lights flickering in the distance a thought comes to me and I wipe the tear from my cheeck  for I know that the valley will live on in my mind and that the true escence of it will never die within my soul  and as I cross the final line of trees claiming the boundries of this noble land I hear the sound of light flutes playing a final fainfair of departure  happy modulating notes devote of fear, anger, and the flaws of man float among the rustleling forest leaves  as I hear those mystefing notes a smile spreads across my face; for I know that at least for now all is good in the valley  and I finally realize that to be and be destroyed is better than to not have been at all ######################################################################################## The universe is vaste, endless, and deep  The mind is prodigious, has no end, and is unfathomable  Therefore the mind and the universe are one  In the universe there is the whole, the clusters, the galaxies, the stars, and the bodies  In the mind there is the flesh, the portions, the cells, the thoughts, and the subconcious.  Within the bodies there are the elements, the material and the makeup  Within the subconcious there are the ethics, the things that make a man  Outside the universe is nothing; the abcence of thought, of being, and of life  To humans, outside the mind is nothing; it is not thought, therefore it can not be and is not life  So, to be thought is to be  To not be thought is not to be   ########################################################################################  life  like a grain of sand on this selestial beach is minute  it is insignificant in the whole  it's existance is dependant upon the static  the non-life  but when the life, like with a land slide on the beach, acts as one  the static is defeated  not yet in this world has the life won  for the static still wields power  not untill the life can act as one unit, as a dune of sand, can it win  still today different grains of sand roll different ways  different grains still try to overpower others  different grains are still greedy, proud, and ignorant  not untill all the grains work as one will we truly be free of the static  and then, and only then, will true life begin  ########################################################################################

      your eyes  they are like beautiful pools of thought contained within a darkness deeper than the celestial emtiness  like a divine force they draw me to you  bringing me closer to the wonderful soul trapped within those heavenly spheres  for within the darkness their is a twinkle of light  nothing more than a slight speck  but a speck so pure, so concentrated with the joy of life and humanity, it overpowers the darkness and opens it like a vail  when I stare into the void and witness this escaping of the soul I am awestruck  for to see this flicker of light is to see the true you  the one that I truely love

      darkness  like a dreadful snake it wrapes it's light ingulfing extensions across the land  in a fading light the protector bids farewell as it's last hopeful rays streak across the sky  it leaves only to be replaced by the widow  she wonders across the sky never sure where to be and how to light a full flame  when the widow rises fear and terrible portents follow in it's wake  and a world of shadow and ash appears  and all the was holsem in the day becomes dead and lifeless  not untill the protector bursts through the horizen in furry, because of the incompetence of the widow, does the world seem whole again  and the extensions of the night draw back to the shadows in retreate only to return again with the widow and a chance to again kill the joy that is day  so do not scorn at the protector for he is the gaurdian, the one true protector of all that we hold dear

      the stars like specks of heaven they rain down their escence reminding us of our insignificance, of our distance, and of our beauty within these heavenly globes there are memories and emotions memories of ages long gone, of places to far away to imagine  they send to us, through the celestial void, the emotions of forgoten kings, of lost loved ones, and of our forefathers  to look into the stars is to see the past and with it maybee see the future

      humanity though it was created in God's image it was corrupted by the seed of the devil this seed thrives on the weak souled, the lame, the proud, and the stupid through the years these dogmas feed the seed, letting it grow eventually engulfing all that God once held dear in us in the end this man becomes a shrivled image of His grace, becoming nothing but evil but in the good this is different for through the grace of God the seed is crushed before it can corrupt and the power of the Lord expands through the body like blood though veins only then is the true image of God represented only then can a person exclaim I AM a child of god

      THESE ARE SOME THOUGHT ON THE QUOTE "I THINK THEREFORE I AM"  I think therefore I am I am is to be To be is to exist To exist is to have physical characteristics To have physical characteristics is to consist of matter within the universe  To think is to make choices not based on instinct To make choices not based on instinct is to be human To be human is to be you  So, if YOU consist of matter within this universe, you ARE  ________________________________________________________________________________________  To think of something is to make it be So, to be is to be thought of ________________________________________________________________________________________  To think is to use the escence of one's soul to conclude something This escence is what is unique to us and makes us be So when you cease to think then your escence ceaces to be and you no longer are

      the warrior, wearing his blazing suit of fire, races across the void the rogue, always chasing the warriors trail, always in pursuit the warrior runs in a straight path his course rarely changes through the seasons but the rogue is superior he hides himself in a partial vail of darkness he changes his path often, sometimes appearing before the warrior only to wait and let him pass, untill the perfect chance and when that chance comes the rogue leaps onto the warrior and puts out his fire bringing the world into darkness but the warrior always wins for he is strong and his suit can be reforged, he mockes the rogue with a blinding light and then the chase begins again never to end untill the end of time itself

      the wind  like a traveling gypsee it whirls around the world playing it's invisible music for all  winding through canyons, through the trees, into the smallest creveces of the earth  it sees all and is with all, but is not seen and is not really with  unknown by many, the wind has many feelings and moods  for it can bring a soft breeze presenting a plesent air to those present  or it can build up and reek havok on those it wishes to destroy  showing no mercy and using the objects of the world as it's fists through the air  so, to us the wind can be both a blessing and a curse  so do not anger the wind  for when mad, it shows no mercy

      the moon  like a widowed lady she shines her remorseful light upon the earth  when whole, she is round and proud, but often she is incomplete, she hides herself from the world  why does she do this?  what terrible event happened in her past to cause her such woe  and what are those marks upon her white face  are they memories, dark upon the light, bad against the good  are they terrible events she wants hidden in the sands of time  i'm afraid we shall never know  for in her fear she does not speak  so learn from the lady, do not cower and be silent, be strong and be heard  do not let the bad fade into the past for, like the lady, you will never be whole

      Life.  Sometimes I ask myself.  Why are we here.  Who put us here.  Why are we, we.  As I stare into the starry void in the quite confines of the night I realize that in this prodigious expanse of dead gas and dust there is a diamond in the ruff.  Earth.  Known through the ages as aarde, verden, maa, mondiale, Erde, dunia, tsuchi, çåìë, kiwanja, and mull.  No matter what language it is in Earth still names one thing.  The beautiful rock in the void where life was made, where life found a way, where all the emptiness is compensated for.  For even if the infinite expanses of the universe are void a single person, a single cell, a single cup of coffee, a single smile, makes it all worth while.  And when I think of this I realize that the univerese is'nt empty because life is a mistake.  It is empty so that we can appreciate that what we have is rare, that it is beautiful, and that it should be charished more than anything.  And this gives me a hint to why we are here.  We are here, plain and simply, to be.  Though this blink of time that we are on this earth is short by the prodigious standerds of the universe.  Each moment is beautiful for it only happens once.  And because life is short we charish it so.  So when I contemplate with myself why I am here I just smile and say to myself, life exists for this moment and for every moment before it and after.  And I know that no true answer to life will ever be given in this existence.  And I am happy becuase i know to have knowledge and to mourn is worse than to be naive and be blissfull.  So charish each moment like it is your last and remember that each will only happen once.

      Like the eyes of the serpent you draw me to you.&nbsp; You wrap my mind in a spell of bedazlement as you spin your treterous web around me.&nbsp; Though you are an evil mistress of the underworld your face is that of the angels and your voice that of the sirens of the distant seas.&nbsp; The more I try to fight you the more beautiful you become.&nbsp; I hate you, yet love you.&nbsp; You are ugly, but beautiful.&nbsp; I hate every fiber of your being, yet to live without you is to not live.&nbsp; For there is nothing but you, only you, and nothing else.  And then as quick as the spell came it ceases.&nbsp; And the dark angel moves on to her next victim.&nbsp; Like an animal she feeds on her pray leaving the toils to rot.&nbsp; And I long for you.&nbsp; The portents of your memory appear everywhere.&nbsp; I see your empowering face in the lake, in the windows, and in the mirror.&nbsp; I hear your encantating voice in the wind, in the earth.&nbsp; To have you is to not want you and to want you is to not have you.  That is the effects of your spell evil mistress.&nbsp; You toil with the heart and at the end of the day, when it interests you no more, you throw it away like a spoiled fruit.&nbsp; Once ripe but then dead.&nbsp; So tread in other's hearts carfully; for to become a mistress of the underworld is to do so.&nbsp; The heart is the strongest and yet&nbsp;the most fragile part of our being.&nbsp; Treat it well.

      as a ride along the peaceful midsummer wind carresces my face like a long lost love the sounds of the night float above me into the starry void above the eastern horizon a baby cries a bird sings a mother walks by speaking soft words&nbsp;to a little boy falling asleep in her arms midnight fisherman cast their lines the crack of a baseball bat at the park kendo sticks slicing the air like knives through butter the wind blows through the trees all of this combining into&nbsp;a great symphony, into a song of life and a simple foreigner stops on his orange bike and admires this cacophony of beauty and a tear rolls down his cheek, why, we no not and he stays there; 5 minutes, 5 days, 5 years in the mind it is all the same he dries his cheeck and continued on humming softly, adding to the orchestra of life the sounds mix and fall into the void, into the memory, into the pastthere it will live forever, never to be lost, always to be&nbsp;remembered
