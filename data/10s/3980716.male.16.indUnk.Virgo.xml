       ..Hey. I'm all alone. xD Joe's on Socom ll talking to Hawk..they're doing something I can't be included in. Heh.&nbsp; I dunno, but whenever Joe and Hawk get together, I feel left out. It's not them, it's me and my idiotic self. xD Dan didn't get on today..Haven't spoken to Art in awhile. He's prolly doing Lou..xD Awhness. I think I have a fever. I can't believe I'm leaving tomorrow..I'm kinda nervous about it..scared when I come back , things are going to be different. A lot different. Joe hasn't said anything yet..Maybe I should talk, but I don't wanna sound pissy. Lol. I'm hopeless..I wonder what he's doing. It must be nice..not having me tagging along..and sucking. xD w00tage. Today's post was short, and I'm not bothering with making it pretty or signing and stuff. Peace out.

        [.I know it's been two days, and I apologize, but of course I will make up for it with tonight's post. Tonight, we shall talk about love, or what I think is love..Mmks..here goes. -dun lemme sound corny God, dun lemme sound corny xD- .] .::I'm not sure about you, but I don't think I could go on forever without love. I look at some people who are around eighty years old and never have a husband or wife..I don't understand how they make it honestly. How can you wake up and see no one beside you? Hear no one snoring..xD? How can you eat alone..dance alone..sing alone..get older alone..die alone?..If there's one thing I think I honestly NEED to survive, it's love. Maybe it's cuz I'm young and stupid and think I'll fall apart If I don't have someone to tell me I'm pretty all the time. -rolls eyes- Whatever! SCREW YOU! lol. I know what I want and need and you do not. -gives you the finger..lol jk- Anyways..ahem..lol..Love seems so great, so..I dunno..beautiful? Lol. Look, I'm trying my HARDEST not to sound totally QUEER! lol. Bare with me. =p I just wonder if anyone..can honestly..ever love me. Like, What if no one will ever fall in love with me?..What if I wasn't made to be with someone?..What if I'll be one of those old ppl I mentioned?=o That'd SUCK. I just want someone to think I'm beautiful when I'm all gross and who'll always love me..who doesnt care if I act stupid a lot or complain..who'll make me breakfast sometimes..and sing me songs..who'll dance wif me in our huge living room with the lights dimmed..who'll think I'm pretty when I'm all fat with our baby =p..someone who'll love EVERYTHING about me..and only me..just someone to be there..forever..no matter what. =\ I dunno, is that too much to ask!? Lol, prolly. =p -reads over it- WOW. THAT'S QUEER SOUNDING. Lol. Oh well. Joe's just got on. w00t. Lol. I LOVE YOU JOE! Yes, so..I'm done. I'll write some more later. Joe and I are doodling xD. Muahs!!! -ill also sign it later lol..- xD::.    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; LLLLLLLLLLLLLAAAAAAAAATTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTEEEEEEEERRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR     &nbsp;   [.-Screams head off..- Siiighhhh. Screw love, no one wants to hear that shit. So..today was ok. I sat around all day..and waited..for a certain someone. He had good reasons this time. w00t. Dan and Mark kinda entertained me in our conference. Thanks guys. I just had ice cream. It was good. Joe and I are arguing again. w00t. See how much we LOVE each other? xD It's awesome. I can't wait til Tuesday..Miami is going to rock..BIG TIME. Four days..away..with God. Maybe&nbsp;Him and I&nbsp;can discuss how crappy my life is right now? Yea? Ya think? We'll see. Or maybe I'll catch a disease LOL. w00tage. Yea..i dun giveee a fuckk..I need VODKA. Lol. xD Vodka Vodka Vodka..Vodka is LOVE. :X -hugs Vodka- D00d..Im hungry again. And I'm listening to Matchbox 20..omg. how cool am I? VERY. -nods- Tomoorroowww hoooppeefuullyyyy I will be spending time wif my girl..we're gonna get drunk and party..LOL..jk..or am I? Lol xD Dunno.

            .::Sigh. Things have been really cruddy lately. I know it's a bit early, but I wanted to write today's post now. Mmks, so let's talk about how I'm feeling at the moment, shall we?  My day:  I woke up at 7:40, because I had some fucking nightmare about roaches. x_X Then, I got online. No one was on so I sat there..and went on Neopets. (w00t) At around..nine o'clock, Krystal called and asked if I could babysit Desmond and Damon for a few hours. I had no problem with it and I need the money so I agreed. So I sat online more..doing nothing..watching my pathetic life rot away with a machine propped up on my knees..-sigh- Then Joe got on, or did he get on when I first got on?.. He might have, I don't remember really. I was half asleep.Soo..SKIP ALL THE OTHER BORING ADVENTS OF MY DAY SO FAR TO NOW. I'm listening to stupid ass depressing songs, my stomach is ripping apart, Joe and I are like..I dunno. Dan is er..smelling his fingers and yawning like always while hugging his knees. I was going to put his funny blanket pictures on here, but I don't think they suit the mood I'm in. Sorry pal. -sigh- Anyways, I have church this afternoon where I will figure out how much I still owe for the Miami trip next week. I have a feeling it will be around $150. w00t. I'm glad my parents have offered to pay that $250 trip, maybe I'll actually enjoy myself. Who knows? Anyways, I made plans this weekend to go see a movie with Sam and maybe Kim and Larissa..holy fuck my stomach hurts..=\..yea anyways..so back to that, when I'm supposed to be going on the church encounter and bringing my friends with me. So if Carrie calls you Sam, say I've been begging you to go, mmks? Thanks I appreciate it. Ow..my stomach..is ripping..apart. Ahem, so yea. Here I am, moody, angry at the world, wondering when I'm going to get my shower or if I'll even take one, and also wondering if eating that brownie mix with raw eggs in it made me sick..who knows? But I also felt bad last night and I didnt eat brownie mix them..Ow..-stare-..it doesnt hurt..it doesnt hurt..it ISNT killing me..

            [.Lovely Pic , eh?.]   .:: Today sucked really, and Limp Bizkit's music isn't helping my mood. I'm so damn moody;it's really unhealthy. I don't feel quite as ugly anymore. I guess it as a phase thing. -shrug- I fucking hate how I come off as some hugely perverted bitch online. -kicks self- Today at the hospital I almost fell asleep again. w00tage. "It's my way or the highway." I want to go out with Samantha. We have tons of fun together! And she said I was beautiful. xD I LURVE YOU SAMANTHA! Anyways, I was on mic with Joe;he fell asleep. I heard him breathing hard/half snoring for awhile..but I suppose the mouse moved somehow away from the mic, so I exited out of the conference. -sigh- I wish he was on. Today on Neopets (w00tage!!) someone said their dad died like..I think it was two weeks ago, and I think I realised how much I loved my dad. I freakin' love how he smells..I remember when I was little and he'd go out of town for a few days, I'd smell his shirts. It's this weird thing. Lol. I know, I'm weird.  Well..As far as me and Joe are going, I think it's a lot better. We didn't fight today at all and I'm getting Socom ||, so I can play online with him. He doesn't think I'll spend that much money though. Just wait.  Lauren got online today drunk, Heh. She and Justin broke up. I'm sad she's upset about it, but maybe it's for the best. He treats her like shit a lot of the time. She deserves someone so much better. She's so fucking awesome. ^_^. And Adam got mad cause I'm with Joe..which he never knew. So he's deleted me. I'm getting upsetting letters from Jon. =\ Why can't he just stop? He knows what he says hurts me. =\ What an ass. Yea..  Oh! This morning I was woken up by a rooster. Funny thing is, I don't have a rooster. xD Har Har. MMks. I'm done for today! ::.  -Y4[]-[]0o_w[]-[]0|2e    [.Kiss Kiss...My Ass!.]     |F|R|I|E|N|D|S| |L|I|K|E| S|A|M| |A|N|D| |L|A|U|R|E|N|    MY Anti-Drug.

        [.Well.. Last night I was talking to all my wonderful friends and my baby, Joe, when I realised how beautiful my chic friends are. Talk about a freaking wake up call when I looked in the mirror. =\ Maybe it was because I seriously needed a shower and wasn't wearing any makeup, but I felt incredibly UGLY. Horrid. I wanted to cut my face off like in Hannibal..Well..Okay, I wasn't that ugly, but I sure as hell could have been A LOT prettier. -We interupt this message to inform you that Lauren and Justin are once again..irritated with each other..ahem..-  So..back to my self esteem problems..-rolls eyes- I think maybe I should start working out? And tanning or something?

        [. Today..I screamed at Ally for getting into Lauren's business. Yes, I did. w00t. Go me. Then some things happened wif Joe. -Jess acted like she liked him. -I told him to be nicer to me. -I noticed all the pictures of "Pretty Kitty" in his photo album.  -sigh- I don't know. I know that was like..before he met me, but still. -another sigh- Maybe it's nothing. It probably is. -tells self over and over again that it is nothing-  Ahem..Yes, so..  Err..nothing else really happened. I like..pwned on Neopets..Lmfao. Yes, yes I did.  Here is a picture I ran across.]      [.I liked it.

        [. Joe. I think I'd be completely LOST without you. Whenever I feel absolutely shitty..or crushed..or..just..BLAH..you're there. Yea, sure we argue a lot..and do =\ a lil too much, but when we get along..which is most of the time..everything feels PERFECT. I love how you say the cutest things on socom..and how yr sexy orange font shows up when I get online. I love how you get all mad when yr doing bad and I have to tell you , that you pwn and stuff. =D. I like having to remind you of things..---AHEM DID U TAKE YR MEDICINE JOSEPH?!--- And how if someone kills me, you usually get em back for me and lay on my poor man socom body. =) I love how you say "Cmere Dev..", or the random "I Love You, Dev Dev." And how you get all pissed when they shoot you and you go.."No FUCKING WAY! I FUCKING shot him on the FUCKING ramp.." It's soo cute how you get all worked up over it. It's also cute how you say I pwn you..=X. And how you always use that lame excuse of how I just got the game when people wanna say they got me good. =D Joe, I've had it for like..weeks. GET OVER IT! I suck..at the game, and you of course. =X. I love how you think i sound cute and laugh when i say really STUPID things like.."AWh, You Fell." Or.."Awh, You died." =) I love how you're always putting me first over yourself, and how you put up with my moody moments a lot. I love your voice..how you sing the Muffin Man..how you get all upset if someone adds me..how you go.."Are you ok? You don't sound too happy." Or how we go.."DUN DUN DUN!!" When we start, if we remember. =p. I love how we right about each other in our blogs too. =X That rawks. =p We're so making a PWNING PENIS clan..Or..Rock-A-Cock LOL..Something..and I'm so s1x733n 1nch35. ;;).

      Hey look, I'm a guy and I'm posting in a blog. Aren't I cool? Anyway, today is not a good day; in fact, it's it's the perfect  BAD  day.&nbsp; I got into a car accident. Before I tell you about that, I read my sweet hearts blog today and it seems I've been leaving her out a lot lately when my friend Ervey is on. I'm really sorry sweetie, I feel stupid and I take full blame, I should have payed more attention to you.  You guys, Dev is  incredible . Dev goes out and buys all this expensive stuff just to play with me on SOCOM II, a Playstation 2 game. It's like the sweetest thing anyone has  EVER  done for me; because she did it to play with me and spent a lot of money on it! I know she loves me and I love her too. You spoil me Dev!&nbsp;Dev dev, YOU are the greatest!  Okay, this morning sometime after Dev went to bed, I got on the couch and layed down. I quickly realized that this is how most of my accidental naps take place, so I got up and decided I will take my Dad's car for a "spin" to get used to driving that stick shift better, and mostly to drive fast. Boy was I in for an unexpected surprise.
