      I'm really tired now, I've been doing yard work for just about all day. Mowing, Trimming,  and Pruning. Sure I had help, but I still feel like falling over and sleeping. But alas, I have some things to do.  I'm in the process of converting a table layout to XHTML and CSS (tableless). Its not too easy, but with  urlLink glish's amazing CSS layouts  as a guide, I'm managing.  Before I finish, I just want to tell anyone that reads this to  Post a Comment!  I feel like no one even comes here. Hey, maybe nobody does... :(

       Mood : Very Sad   Weather : Nice and Sunny (Happier than I am)  Well this is it. After some testing, and thinking, this is my blog v 0.9 Almost done ;)...  My favorite Anime got lisenced by Funimation today, no more amazing subbed episodes for me. It's called FullMetal Alchemist, and in short - its amazing. I wish there was somthing I could do, but I'm afraid there isn't. I don't have Cable or Satelite, so I probably won't be able to watch it when it comes on TV. It make me so angry. Well that's the downlight for today.
