      Today was the last day of school. The variety show was good. Except for the string part. We were good, but we just stood out too much. I'll play bass next time.  urlLink Toma  got some well deserved awards today. Except for the Bill Gates award. No offense Toma, but  urlLink Michael Flagg's Computer Company  deserved that one. Good work emceeing all of you that did it! Go Boerner as Michael Jackson! Not really.     urlLink Mandolin  sat by me today during the assembly! Ha ha Mr. Newendork. Thought you could make me sit with my own team twice? Ha.

      President Bush sigened my award today. That means several things.   1) I am never trusting any outside-of-school-but-funded-by-it programs.       2) I will burn this award.   3) He is trying to convince me to support him. Even though I cannot vote.   4) Kerry is just as bad.

      A few days ago, there was a mentally retarded bird in my garage. I say "Shoo bird. Don't bother me." "Get out," This bird had one concept down: in. To make matters worse, when I scared him away, he went right back  in . So I scream "Get out, you (censored) (censored) (censored) BIRD BRAIN!" Miraculously, the combination of that and the broom caused him to leave. Stupid bird.

      Today,  urlLink Mandolin ,  urlLink Nick , and Peige were my companions during today's Adventureland Trip. Peige was a bossy wimp, Nick was hyper, Amanda was great and went on the roller coasters with me. It was all Peige's fault. If it wasn't for peige, I wouldn't be sitting on a towel as I type this. Peige is evil. It was unroomy the second time at the covered wagon ride that I don't remember the name of. Peige talked bad about me. There was also a great war on where we all were after a while. We finally met on the Ski lift thingy. It was odd. Today has been strange. But fortunately, I had Mandolin to burst out laughing randomly with me.

"Monty Cobra and the Holy Pail" didn't go quite as far as I had hoped. Sad. I could have been Gollum. That would probably work, actually. I can picture myself crouched down saying "Yes, precious we must cross downstage to Shelob's trapses." Dang.

        You're Most Like The Season Winter ...  You're often depicted as the cold, distant season. But you're incredibly intelligent, mature and Independant. You have an air of power around you - and that can sometimes scare people off. You're complex, and get hurt easily - so you rarely let people in if you can help it. You can be somewhat of a loner, but just as easily you could be the leader of many. You Tend to be negative, and hard to relate to, but you give off a relaxed image despite being insecure -  and secretly many people long to be like you, not knowing how deep the Winter season really is.  Well done... You're the most inspirational of seasons :)    urlLink   ?? Which Season Are You ??     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla

      I'm finally getting around to what happened to me over the weekend. I went to Worlds of Fun thru orchestra. To tell you the truth, on Saturday, it wasn't much fun. Nick got lost, and we had to look for him, the lines were too long, and I ran into Ted. No further explanation necessary.   Now at the hotel, the chef clearly knew that his contract said he cooks for 88 people. There were 133 of us. Mr. Barr got angry, to say the least. Nick got a major migraine (probably from Ted), so he didn't swim w/ us. He didn't miss much.   On Sunday, Mr. Barr said we had to get a '1' rating or higher when we perform. I felt really bad after knowing that because of all the (censored) (censored) (censored) (censored) (censored) freaks who don't give a (censored) about how we (censored) sound, we got a '2' rating. NONE of Mr. Barr's groups had ever gotten below a '1'. I was cheered up with short lines and Mr. Barr going on the Rip-Cord. His hair was blowing everywhere. Pichler and Swank payed. Lucky Mr. Barr.

      For all of us who feel only the deepest love and affection for the way  computers have enhanced our lives, read on. At a recent computer expo COMDEX),  Bill Gates reportedly compared the computer industry with the auto industry and  stated, "If GM had kept up with technology like the computer industry has, we  would all be driving $25.00 cars that got 1,000 miles to the gallon".   In response to Bill's comments, General Motors issued a press release   stating: If GM had developed technology like Microsoft, we would all be   driving cars with the following characteristics   (And I just love this part.)   1. For no reason whatsoever, your car would crash twice a day.   2. Every time they repainted the lines in the road, you would have to buy a  new car.   3. Occasionally your car would die on the freeway for no reason. You would  have to pull over to the side of the road, close all of the indows, shut off  the car, restart it, and reopen the windows before you could continue. For some  reason you would simply accept this.   4. Occasionally, executing a maneuver such as a left turn would cause your car  to shut down and refuse to restart, in which case you would have to reinstall  the engine.   5. Macintosh would make a car that was powered by the sun, was reliable, five  times as fast and twice as easy to drive-but would run on only five percent of  the roads.   6. The oil, water temperature, and alternator warning lights would all be  replaced by a single "This Car Has Performed An Illegal Operation" warning  light.   7. The airbag system would ask "Are you sure?" before deploying.   8. Occasionally, for no reason whatsoever, your car would lock you out and  refuse to let you in until you simultaneously lifted the door handle, turned the  key and grabbed hold of the radio antenna.   9. Every time a new car was introduced car buyers would have to learn how to  drive all over again because none of the controls would operate in the same  manner as the old car.   10.You'd have to press the "Start" button to turn the engine off.

      It all started at...David's house. I saw him...PLAYING A GAME! I quickly took a snapshot as proof, then went to the police station. I showed them the photo, and they said something I've heard one too many times. They said,"You're crazy." I was utterly shocked, to say the most. But then...the police officer ripped off a mask showing that he was...a Republican. You don't want to run into them into dark alley. Fortunately, I was in the police station, not in a dark alley. Unfortunately, it was dark in the police station that wasn't a dark alley. So I say to him "Look! Yet another Middle-Eastern Country to blow to bits and make them free but really under our control!" and I point behind him. Being a Republican, he fell for it. I ran. It was bad, to say the most. But I was desperate. I needed to find an authority. I ran into a Janitor. He asked me if a toilet backed up. I told him that the Republican in the police station was after me, and that he needed a push to the right. Unfortunately, he was a Leftist. He jumped me. I couldn't stop him. He took out a knife conveniently hidden in the toilet. I kicked him, and fled. That made two evil people after me. Then, I met the worst person I could ever meet in person who I knew was evil. Al Gore. He said,"Are you okay? Y'know, I invented being okay!" I ran...again. I was shot by a random person, and died. The Beginning.

      I just forgot something about the party 2 nights ago. After I left, and was waiting for my friend's ride, we saw what had to be a drunk man. He walked up to us. Then he said "You're just kids". Then he walked very crooked following someone random into a hotel. Then he left, crossed the street, and was nearly ran over. I didn't know what to make sense of this at the time, but this morning I found it to be funny/serious.

      I went to a party last night. It was well, interesting. To start off, we did a bad cha cha, and people always ran into me. Isn't that right, Nick?! Oh well. Second, We tried to play a card game, and end up simply playing the sacred game of 52 pickup. Yippee. Third, my shoe was captured, and people played soccer with it. Yes, my shoe. Finally, a little guy with glasses. When he had to leave, for some reason he just wouldn't stop laughing! I don't get it! We didn't do anything funny! He just started laughing! So remember this incident when you here the phrase "Drugs are bad for you."

It is not a freackin' ketchup company! It's an M not an N! Ahhhhhhhhhh! Sorry. Next, the last name "Patton" was located after the name "Wise". A violinist goes to Assumption. So the assume he goes to school? One person was home schooled, and and the program said he goes to Woodrow Wilson Jr. High. The last one I'm going to mention is that Indian Hills Junior High School was located at Clive and West des Moines. I incredibly hate the program and the reason I cannot mention any more is that I burned the program and those are the only ones I remember.

      Hello. There was once a boy who was born with just a head. His mom put his head on the window sill, so he could at least watch the other kids with bodies play. But one day, his mom robbed Fort Knox, and payed for a complex surgery, giving her little boy a body. So when he was ready, he asked "Mommy, can I go play with the other kids?" The mother said yes. So the child walked out the door, and got hit by a car. So I guess the moral of the story here is "Quit while you're a head".

I showed them the photo, and they said something I've heard one too many times. They said,"You're crazy." I was utterly shocked, to say the most. But then...the police officer ripped off a mask showing that he was...a Republican. You don't want to run into them into dark alley. Fortunately, I was in the police station, not in a dark alley. Unfortunately, it was dark in the police station that wasn't a dark alley. So I say to him "Look! Yet another Middle-Eastern Country to blow to bits and make them free but really under our control!" and I point behind him. Being a Republican, he fell for it. I ran. It was bad, to say the most. But I was desperate. I needed to find an authority. I ran into a Janitor. He asked me if a toilet backed up. I told him that the Republican in the police station was after me, and that he needed a push to the right. Unfortunately, he was a Leftist. He jumped me. I couldn't stop him. He took out a knife conveniently hidden in the toilet. I kicked him, and fled. That made two evil people after me. Then, I met the worst person I could ever meet in person who I knew was evil. Al Gore. He said,"Are you okay? Y'know, I invented being okay!" I ran...again. I was shot by a random person, and died. The Beginning.

      Today, I saw Dean at the Temple of Performing arts. He was on lunch break, so he talked w/ violinfreak and I. Since I'm rather the absent-minded, forgetful, and just plain stoopid type, I didn't remember who he was. He reminded me. Needless to say, it was pretty embarrassing.

      Sunkist and I think it's time people stopped referring to lousy products as lemons. I mean, there's nothing defective about lemons. They're fun, flavorful and packed with vitamin C. Any product should be proud to be called a lemon; they're that good for you. In fact, the next time somebody tells you to go suck a lemon, you tell them, "Hey, thanks for caring about me."     You guys think it'll work?
