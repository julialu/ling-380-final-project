        wow. I'm so exhausted.&nbsp; so much is going on. Today was out last day of camp and im not to stoked about the way i threw. Monday i did ok which was rather shocking cuz my&nbsp;shoulder&nbsp;didn't hurt. Tuesday i did really well and wednesday i sucked. He wanted to see my drop alot and it just wasn't workin out. So yeah. And then today my shoulder was killing me so i sucked even worse. Anyways this morning the doctor dude called mom and told her that its seperated and he wants to do surgery after the season. The deal is he said it takes 6 to 8 months to heal&nbsp;completely and i only have 4 after highschool ball before for the maverics start up agian. and theres no way i can even go for months with out pitching cuz i'll be screwed. Anyways my dads taking me down to arizona to visit the campus next week and im stoked. I've wanted to play for the wildcats for like..ever. lol.     &nbsp;   Jesse just went back to doing the same things he did before. Pete came over and gave me like the worst most romantic moment of my life. So i'm spending the week at Harlies apartment ~

      i spent the night at eric's last night. Life is pretty much stinky right now. Everyone thinks i broke up with jesse but i haven't. (atleast not yet)And of course he is being really sweet. i don't know wether its because he knows im not happy or because he is finally over this jealous asshole faze. either way im totally confused. anyways...i went over to eric's last night and we watched a ben stiller movie marathon and i showed him some tape of roger federer ( HOTTIE ). he deffinatly thinks roger is hot cuz he was like salivating the whole time. anywho we just hung out and it was kinda relaxing and then sharon made us hot cocoa and i fell asleep. Anyways this morning we went for a run and then slept some more. i came home and i had 8 missed calls. 2 from allie and the rest from jesse and mom said he called the house alot too. So i guess i should call him back but i don't feel like it yet. Me and eric talked alot about it and i had forgotten how easy he was to talk to about everything so he was really helpful. Now i have -

      i'm so confused about everything right now.i don't even know if me and jesse are even dating...we are kinda just there...its sucks because i used to love to spend time with him because he was so perfect for me...he just...i dunno got me..its crazy now tho. i mean i can't talk to him like i could before. before i didn't even have to tell him how something made me feel cuz he could tell me how it made me feel and he could listen to me talk about how insecure i am and how nothing feels real around me and he always knew what to say. now he just makes me feel like im stupid and tells me that im cheating on him. im not. and we fight so much and he takes everything i say the oposite of how i meant it.Before i met jesse there were like 3 people in the world that had any idea what was going on inside me head at any point in time. I mean brody and allie are my best friends and i think its becuase they have known me for so long that they just understand how i am. and then vaughn was like the *first love* thing and he was the only good thing that happened to me last year. and then he just up and leaves. And right when i feel like im getting over that i meet jesse. I mean he was so cool back then but now it just sucks. it sucks that we were ever that close because now we aren't. and i want so bad to end it because i feel like maybe me and pete could have something but probably not. and everytime i try to tell jesse how im feeling i think about how it used to be and i never say anything...damn.  ~peyton pryce~   CHECK OUT- she's gunna break soon by less than jake
