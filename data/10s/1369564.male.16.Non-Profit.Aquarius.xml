      yesterday was fun. i went on a road trip(sort of) with my dad to go get my sister from college, and her friend too. the first 5 hours were so boring. we got there and took some pictures got whits stuff and went to go get D and her stuff. on the way home it was boring for the first hour or so till i got in the back with whit and D. we played on my sisters computer for a while till we got to a McDicks. then we ate. after that we started writing this story on her computer. its a game where u pass the story around and someone adds something like half a sentence untill someone ends the story. anyway. we got bored of that after awhile and started saying tounge twisters and i suck at those so i just played on my sisters computer. then we all started singing acopella songs till we got thome.   cabe

      Movie Night was fun. Rachel seemed very lonely without spencer. Watched about half the movies half as much as I wanted to. Had a garlic biscuit and milk. I had a little too much of girls swooning over depp for one night, even for one hour. Thats what happens when u say ok to chic flicks. Well I deal with it.

      So, its tuesday and i haven't talked about Hershey yet. What the hell is wrong sith me? Hershey kicked ass. Hershey makes up for the lack of number of coasters with the heart stopping speed and hieght of the coasters. It was awsome. waiting in line with my best friends for an hour and a half for a 45 second ride...is the best thing u could do with a saturday. Other than a movie day with the gang at rachels. Brought 15 bucks and came home with 4.50 and an empty stomach. Nothin like a day at Hershey park. Oh and that was the worse we have ever played devil. What are we doin, gettin suckyer rather than betterer?

      Hey Rachel this ones for you.  Im listening to Pissin In The Wind by Jerry Jeff Walker. You probably don't know what or who that is but i bet u know what Mr. Bojangles is. Good song, if u don't know it come on down to my place ill play it for u.  Went to the art festivale in town with keri today. It was fun. Saw lots o' very good stuff. I almost bought somthin but then realised that its expensive. You know me, cheap as shit man.  Also had a very fun time at the bull with rach, chrissy and dan. Pretty good fun. Expensive and chrissy still owes me ten bucks. Miss waitress was a bitch. We had a fun time hangin out for an hour outside too.  And the last day of school was fun too. You know in that "last day of school this year" kind of way. Spent most of the morning in Imriseks room, fun stuff, with other people there. I think he called me Cabe, no mr. I. Its Caleb to u mister.

       Why do I burn and pine for her? Why can't I get over this girl? Why do I love her more than anything else in the world? Can some one tell me this or at least tell me how to get over her. Seriously, I want to know because I can't do it. Its so hard to be  just  her friend. I can't help but want to be alone with her whenever I see her.

       RAIN. A word as simple as that, can give such an image. Of love, in the rain. I can see a boy and a girl, standing. It begins to rain. The girl looks up from his embrace and smiles. Forhead wet with rain, and those beautiful eyes so full of emotion, they close o' so slowly. And he kisses her in the most intimate expression of love. The feeling just radiating off of the two. The kiss ends the same as it began but eyes open instead of close. Still looking at him she bites her lip in the most enticing way possible. Another embrace. Forever love as I want it for me.

       I want to live in the country again, surounded by woods all around. I want to wake up in the middle of a summers night, lay on my deck and watch the stars. I want to hear the birds all day and fall asleep to the sound of a chorus of insects chirping into the night. I want to be closer to her. I want to be away from it all. School, the city, working, and just enjoy it. I want to feel the warm rain on my face as i lay in the grass. I want to live as if i have not a care in the world. But don't we all?

       It really does feel like ive had a large knive slowly shoved into my heart, but quikly. Its like a jab. A heart stopping moment, when u realize how much life sucks. How much u loved and still love her. But its someone elses hand shes holding. She never did that with u. She never liked that sort of thing when u were with her. I saw it and ignored it best i could. Best i could. Its like having a lead wieght strapped around your heart like a cold , rusty chain; digging in everytime you move.

       I feel like shit. I've been thinking about how keri treats her friends and im really questioning whether she a good one or not. I've takin so much shit from her over the two years i've been well aquainted to her. We claim to be best friends but really how are u supposed to be friends with someone who blows you off all the time. I should call her sometime i know. Everytime she asks me to walk with her upstairs carl or josh comes along and im left in the dust. But on the other side, how exciting am i? not very. Im about the most boring person i know. I son't do anything, i hate the thought of having responsibility, im not very active, i don't ever have anything worth talking about and the list goes on. All i like really is science and math and im not even that fuckin good at either. I claim to be an electronics geek but really i can't do anything with that shit. I admit that i know more than the average joe but not much more. I wait for things to happen to me and blame everyone else when nothing comes to me. One word to describe me: LOSER.

          Shes so beautiful. Most of the time Ican't take my eyes off of her. I love it when her hair is all a mess. I love her eyes, though dark they light up my world. Her ears look completely differernt and unequal, thats the way she likes things. She doesn't like it when things are "even". Her rosy, cute nose. Her teeth, always clean, unlike mine. Shes just so cute.    I love how she writes though she doesn't give me much to read. I wish I could see some of her most recent works though she'll never let me. I love her art work too. The way she just doodles swirling and swaying lines. It just looks so easy for her. I still have the tiger on my fridge, signed with love. She belittles her talents so much. And so do I. But i don't mean to. Im a horrible critic and Im always looking for something to make better. I criticized one of her works last year and she got really pissed off. No matter how many times I say Im sorry, she'll never forgive me for saying it. It was a stupid comment and I wish for all the world if I could take it back, but i can't. It'll always be there in the back of her mind and mine the way I insulted her art.    I just wish so much to change the many stupid things I've said to her in ignorance.    I love how she loves the rain. I love it when we're outside and its raining and her hair is wet and messy and shes soaked to the bone, but shes still standing there, in front of me and I kiss her, in the rain.    I wish I had been more romantic instead of the raging hormones boy. Man, I never saw her before it was too late. I was trapped, entranced by her...everything.

       I love her. Ands its not just the love between friends. I still love her as I did when we were together. But thats not enough. I know so much about her that most people don't. It feels like i know her too well to be just friends, but thats what she wants. I know what was wrong and I caught on too late. She says its no ones fault, but I know, it was mine. I guess we didn't do much. At least we didn't do too many  different  things. I just wish I had another chance, but its too late for that. Way too late.

       You know sometimes i wish i hadn't even been born into this family. Sometimes. I love them all, but when we're all together its chaos. At least between my parents. They divorced when i was five, then got remarried about eight years ago then divorced AGAIN a year ago. And all the while quiet little caleb stands by idly and watches it all in perfect detail. I was so tired of the fights. Always fighting, yelling, crying, screaming. My sister, whitney 18 years old now, and i used to huddle up in her room to comfort each other. There were holes in doors and other broken things along with our spirits. Josh, now 23, was lucky he only had to deal with one divorce at least living through it. Im 16 now and i don't show it, but it hurts. Its always there in the back of my mind. Sometimed i just want to cry, but i realize its uslessness. I love my family very much, but when my parents get together its not fun.

       when you get so many chances to fix a problem and don't. Then when its finally over for good...you realize how you might fix that problem. Isn't life sucky like that?

      i love being with you. i love goin to ur house for movie nights. i would rather it be just u and me at movie nights. instead of everyone else. its not that i don't like them, its just that i like u more.  y don't u just dump spencer. i don't get whats so amazing about someone whoblows u off even as ur boyfriend. A-S-S-H-O-L-E. u deserve so much better.  im not saying u deserve me because i don't deserve u. i can't even decribe how wonderful u are.  spencer will probably end up very sucsessfull. if u end up with him u'll be married to a sucsessfull man. i probably won't grow up to be squat. ill probably be a dvd repairman or electronics repairman with a little shop on the corner. i would scoff at myself right now but its kind of hard to put a scoff in writing. lol.  now whos pathetic?

      Its funny the way feelings go. And how you don't really know what the hell your feeling half the time. At least I don't. I've had these feelings and still have no idea what they mean. Like, Love, and why I feel this way.  And how do we express these feelings, thought inexplicable,&nbsp;to the person your feeling them towards? Especially if that person already has someone that they "feel" about or rather have "feelings" towards. Its a tough question. Though a tough question for me may be a very easy one for some one else, but I won't get into that. I come across this almost every day. And someone finally caught it. But I still can't say it. Its pointless.  I wouldn't want to jeopardize the friendship for something that might not even be there.  I've decided against it.
