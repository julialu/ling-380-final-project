         &nbsp;&nbsp;I didn't come to school today. Valied reason: to get application forms from different schools in manila pero dalawa lng napuntahan ko. I first went to FEU bcoz my mom told me to do so, though i don't like that school, being an obedient daughter (nyek) i went to get the form. I was dropped right in front of the main gate. Where people came in and out. Sbi ko sa sarili ko "nako, d ko alm gagawin ko". I was all by myself (w8..kanta un dba?) so nagpunta muna ko sa 7 eleven to get something to eat. I got a chocolate bar and H20 (magpaka scientific ba?). Then i was bound to the gates again. It was like getting inside of one of those rock concerts (as if naman i had gone to one.hehe) ang daming tao!! college peeps!! No, maybe i was just exaggerating sa kadamihan ng tao hndi lng cgro ako sanay. (just so u know guys, my status at that time -

       read first b4 u say anything....      I was happy. My girlfriend and I had been dating for over a year and so we decided to get married. My parents helped us in every way, my friends encouraged me. And my girlfriend? She was a dream! There was only one thing bothering me, very much indeed. That one thing was her younger sister. My prospective sister-in- law was twenty years of age, wore tight mini skirts, and low cut blouses. She would regularly bend down when near me and I got many a pleasant view of her breasts. It had to be deliberate. She never did it when she was near anyone else. One day little sister called and asked me to come over to check the wedding invitations. She was alone when I arrived. She whispered to me that soon I was to be married, and she had feelings and desires for me that she couldn't overcome and didn't really want to overcome. She told me that she wanted to make love to me just once before I got married and committed my life to her sister. I was in total shock and couldn't say a word. She said, "I'm going upstairs to my bedroom, and if you want to go ahead with it just come up and get me."    I was stunned. I was frozen in shock as I watched her go up the stairs. When she reached the top she pulled down her panties and threw them down the stairs at me. I stood there for a moment, then turned and went straight to the front door. I opened the door and stepped out of the house and walked straight towards my car. My future father-in-law was standing outside. With tears in his eyes he hugged me and said, "We are very happy that you have passed our little test he added:We couldn't ask for a better man for our daughter, Welcome to the family!    The moral of this story is:        Always keep your condoms in your car!
