      Tomorrow is my Biology paper for Mid Year. Lol. First time studying for a Biology paper... Kinda having a tough time memorizing all those weird-looking terms. Hopefully my memory wouldn't fail me tomorrow. Played SG since 3 hours ago. Fooking lvl up quite fast. Finally got a MK4 Owl - 5k HP 57 Armor and also MK3 Leviathan - 6k HP 49 Armor. Fooking. Can finally do something as a clouter for my regiment. Feeling hungry the whole day today... Wonder whether I'll be putting on weight soon... Hope not though. I intend to ask my frens to chiong cs and wc3 tml. Lol. Gonna enjoy myself hard this weekend. Almost all polys are gonna start... I'll just have to ask my best frens out before we really can't make out time to go for some gathering anymore... Just hope we all will keep in touch with one another always. Friends forever~ ;)

      Lol. First time taking a Maths exams in such a slacking manner. I spent 1 hour to finish a 2-hours Maths paper. Gonna get owned by my Maths teacher man... Well, wad can I say? JC sux~ I can never deny that. Though some chix may look hotter in JC uniform but still, the studies somehow affects my mood for go to JC.

      Damn tired today. Dunno why yesterday cannot sleep until 2am. -.-" Well, at least I managed to wake up and go to school for exams. Lol. Hmmm, for wad i know, I didn't study for Chinese and only read through about a few pages of Chemistry notes. That's all the preparation I made for the exams today. Lol. Maths paper tomorrow. Gonna feel damn sick cause I hate Maths. =/ As usual, I chill around wif my classmates to "study" but end up eating in the canteen. ^^ I reached home at about 5pm and started sleeping. Zzzzz.... Woke up at 7.30pm to eat my DINNER!! I'm feeling sleepy again... Haiz. How on Earth am I gonna study Maths in this manner? Well, i guess this Mid-Year Exams wouldn't really help me in my promotion exams at the end of the year. Just hope a small miracle would happen. Well, I always believe that some things are just fated. Though we can manipulate fate in some manner, still, fate plays a major role in our lives. Guess I'm gonna start "reading" Maths before i fail my Maths and get OWNED by my bunny-teeth Maths teacher... Gayguy. =(

      Fuking shit! Just when I thought holidays just started, it's ending soon. Furthermore, exams starts tomorrow. Seriously, sux2beme. Woke up at 12pm, went to Shaw to "study" from 1pm to 5pm and then going home to sleep till 8pm and started watching tv. Lol. Don't seem to be studying for tomorrow's exams. ^^  Feeling down now... Suddenly, i've got the feeling to go to poly instead of staying in JC. I kinda feel that JC life doesn't suit me. It's somehow stressful and to me, it ain't that fun. Each time I go to school, I see people studying and studying. It isn't my way of studying but the pressure they give me makes me feel as though I'm nothing but a slacker. I'm not really bothered about that but imagine some people indirectly showing off their good results when they know your results isn't good(It happened before). That kind of feeling isn't something that you can experience everytime. Truthfully speaking, that feeling sux! How I wish i could just give those people a punch!   But nah... I always take things easy. Most of the time in school, I'll just hang around with 2-3 classmates(all male). That's my way of avoiding those who always show off. Of course, this group of friends kinda feels the same way as me. Lol. However, they DO study, very much unlike me. ;P But nevertheless, I'll still try my best to pass this year in order to promote to JC2. If not, "Poly, here I come!"

      Finally, my blog is out!! Feels weird to find myself making a blog though... Lol. Boring day today. Sux2beme.  Still kinda pissed to know that England lost to Portugal. That Beckham is a bloody dickhead, taking a penalty as though it was a free-kick. Nevertheless, it didn't dampen my mood to play Shattered Galaxy(SG)!! Taking damn bloody long to max stats and get my units to max lvl.  Gotta do homework before my chem teacher, Mdm Koh, starts running up to me saying :"Stay back and do your work!" ;( Lastly, must thank Qifang for guiding me through the process of making this blog. ^^  Thanks alot, Qifang ~

      Uh huh, a short day today indeed. From 7am to ard 1pm today, one of the shortest day in a week for me. ^^ Both SC and Darius skipped their lessons(I think) to come to SRJC to see me. I'm so fuking touched. What a pair of best friends to have. But I've got a feeling that they went to SRJC was with the intention of seeing pretty and sexy chix. =(   Anyway, they were waiting at the canteen when I finished my lessons and was on my way to meet them. Man,&nbsp;I can see all eyes turning towards them, especially the girls. Prolly because they were in home clothes, not their looks. =X Well, after having lunch in the canteen, I kinda showed both of them ard the sch. Then we reached near LT5 when I introduced the 'PCC Room' to them. And we took a pic of SC using Darius's phone :       It's pretty lame but it was some funny shet. Lol. After the tour ard my sch, we started to make our way to the jamming studio to JAM ~ Ian was there waiting for us when we reached. Lol. He skipped sch today. =/ Bad boy. It's the wrong thing to do, man.  After jamming, we went to eat ROTI PRATA. Whle eating Roti Prata, we watched the video that Darius, teh fcuking great videoman, took of us jamming... 40+ mins including the video-ing of the ij chix. Not good. ;(   Then SC, Darius and I took cab home. Reached home at 6pm before going to cut my hair. Met E-lynn(nfi who she was at first), Fiona and Aud Ee. Man, seeing the 'chix' all in one day is too much for me. ^^ Coolness. Now my hair can spike. No more long hair to irritate my eyes. Lol. Reached home at about 7.15pm, ate my dinner and slept till 10pm. Chatting wif SC and Darius now. Ciao.   Darius: Remember, this Sat, we'll see whether you've got your balls back. ;)  SC: Darius was pretty serious when he said about the Sat thingy. Well, I guess we better choose good looking chix to see whether he found his balls.&nbsp;^.^  Both: See you guys on Sat. Gonna be fun. Let's watch 'i, robot'. gg

      Darn, the weekend passed so fast. Met SC and Darius yesterday and played Billiard at Cine. We took a fuking long time to finish 2 games... -.-" But it was fun though, except that Darius was sitting there like a retard, making me feel bad.

      Finally, the weekend is here! It's prolly time to be chilling after being in sch for 5 days from 7am to 4pm. =/ Man, it was SRJCians' Day on 21st July. All of us were allowed to wear our home clothes. My 'gang' wore black shirts... So many ppl thought we were Mafia. -.-" Pretty lame though... I realised that I'm not as sociable in JC than I was in BHSS. Owned. ;( Kinda hate the feeling of not knowing alot of ppl in sch. Sux. Time flies and it has been 4 months since my JC started. My best buds just started poly not long ago... Feeling pretty distant from them. I talked to them online but still, the memories of chilling outside still remain inside me. Gonna ask them out and do some shet wif them. Well, I didn't know they were kinda desperate to be in relationship. We chatted about being a 'playAr'. Lol. Feggots. Though I didn't really agree to that idea, I can't stop them from doing wadever they wanna do. ;P CHILLING TIME!!!

      Man, long time nv blog. Maybe not that long but still feels long enough. Didn't use the com for the past 2 days! Missing SG like mad. Was fun during the battles today. All wins. ^^ I just realised that I go to school wif something to look forward to : Weekend is coming soon. Lol. Can't wait for the weekend to come. The previous weekend passed pretty fast. Can't believe my ears when I heard my mum nagging about the start of the week on Sunday... Slept the whole day after school on Friday. Then, I went to Albert's house for class gathering last Saturday after going to school for A Levels Listening Comprehension. Spent the whole day in Albert's house. Was fun though. Played ps2 until my eyes turned fuking tired. Then Sunday came and I did my hw at 5pm as I slept until 4pm. =/ I'm becoming like a pig now... I just hope time passes fast enough. I really can't stand being in JC anymore. It SUX~ Like wad SC and Darius said, Poly

      Man... Kinda depressed at my Mid-Year Exams results... It's not the marks that matters to me, it's how well some others do. I heard that LY scored damn well for her subjects. Using her results to compare with mine is like comparing heaven and hell. This is totally crappy man. THAT'S IT!!! She'll be my sole motivation! I'm gonna work hard and score good marks so as to prove that I can be like her. It's gonna be tough work but I'm sure if I have the determination and patience, I believe I can succeed. Though LY might not know that I'm using her as my motivation and gauge, I just hope that she don't mind if she finds out. This is when my journey starts......

      Wow, today is another slack day. Woke up in the morning and accompanied Albert to TP. The transport fare was $4. =/ Burning a hole in my pocket. Then i went over to Albert's house to chill around and play lancraft wif MH and KS. It was fun, though some of the maps were so lame.

      Today is the most slack day ever since I entered SRJC. Took the Biology exam in the morning and found it quite easy though I only studied for 1 hour. Just hope that I can pass it. After the exam, I went out with my classmates and ate McDonald's. Feeling bored, we went to play bowling... It has been 3 years since I played bowling. Lol. STILL feeling bored, we then went IP and played for 3 hours and then finally went to Kerui's house to sit ard and chill. His cosy little room made me felt as though I was at home. Lol. Wished I could just sleep there... Reluctantly, I left his house and made my way home to play SG!!! Lol. I'm becoming a SG fanatic, just like how Darius became a DA fanatic... ;) Gotta enjoy life now before my school lessons starts again next Tues. But I hope to finish my STOOOOOOPID tutorials by this weekend. Haiz... ;(

      Oh my God, I feel just like a zombie rotting at home. Everything seems to be a routine for me already. Same old things everyday. Boring stuff. But is there anything I can do? No. =(  I didn't blog for a period of time. Nothing interesting happened, so I see no point in blogging. Lol. Well, I still gotta blog once in a while, in case some faggots keep asking me to blog. Zzz. Everyday is the same for me. Leave my house for sch in the morning at 6.30am, reach sch and stay until 5pm, reach home to have dinner at 7pm, revise a little of my work for 1-2 hours, play SG for 1-2 hours, and lastly, sleep. This is some boring shet man. I had been doing this for about 1 month. I'm breaking down...... =(  Hmmm, on 16th August 2004, I got to know this girl from my school called Maxilian (a.k.a. Maxi). I chatted with her online and got to know her better. Ever since sch started, I did notice her but was totally clueless on what the fuck I was doing in SRJC. That period of time was the time when I had no interest in looking at girls, not at all. Sad, yes. But now, I'm BACK TO NORMAL!!! Hehe... Maxi, as a whole, had left a deep impression in my heart. She's the first girl I saw with such fair skin and smooth complexion. I couldn't believe my eyes.

      Man... I watched 'I,ROBOT' with that 2 wiggers last Sat. It was soooo damn cool. Everyone should watch it. After that, we went to play pool at Meridien. Darn, lost to SC 12-2. I guess I've got no skills left anymore. Lol. We then made our way to Darius's house to chill and swim(Again). We had fun again and did some stupid shet again. Love it when we do that. ^^  Well, I was about to go home when SC said that he was too exhausted to even walk. I've got no choice but to stay over at Darius's house again. Lol. Fortunately, Darius's dad wasn't home. But sadly, we didn't do much. Those 2 went to sleep at about 1am? Lol. I played SG at Darius's house from 11pm to 4.30am. Sorry Darius. Didn't tell you about it. =X  I went home yesterday at about 2pm. Slept again and didn't do anything. Time flies and it was this morning. I didn't go to sch cause I forgot to set my alarm. Damn, gonna get screwed tml. I had a LLLLOOOOONNNNNNGGGGGG chat with my mum about Poly and JC stuff. I kinda made up my mind to go to Poly if they allow me to enter at this time. Life sux in JC. Sadly.  Then, I went to SC's house at about 6pm to talk to both Darius and SC about my decision to go to Poly. Darius promised to help me find out about the admission to Poly. Man, love how these 2 guys help me so much. I followed them to UE Square where they had their first lesson for dancing. Lol. Looked kinda funny. While waiting for their lessons to end, i went over to Liang Court and ate Macs. It had been 6 years since I went to Liang Court. Pretty much the same, prolly because my memories aren't as vivid as before already. Took cab+bus home and here I am blogging. Yawns. Time to sleep. Gotta go to sch tml. =(  Ciao.  sczwdar. wiggers4lyfe.
