      whew...back to the story...  at about 10:30 am, we offered our help to  Nanay Cynthia.  I got my bigas and good thing, i know how to cook rice. Good thing i was "prepared" for this activity, how? well, we practically don't have a maid at home for a couple of years now, so im adjusted to the way of life i live, i help my mum and dad cook dinner...enough...this is not about me..lol.  anyways, after i cook the rice, we had some picture taking inside the home. I posed with Steph, Vick, Ryan and Charlo. They were nice little boys who are  not able to taste the lavish life we live.   I don't pity them.  Why? well, they work so hard to maintain their homes, to be able to eat at least 2 times a day... isn't it admirable what these people do?  even if they know they have no clear future in this damned country,  they do everything to survive, they just don't give up. That's something to be proud of.  They (Nanay Cynthia and her family) don't have the mentality of "let's not do something because nothing will ever happen to us in this country", instead, they work and strive hard to eat everyday and send their children to school. We should be proud of those people.  We prepared the fish tempura and we all saw how  Nanay Cynthia  was fascinated on this all-new recipe. we taught her how to cook it. Vicky put out the fish and we sort of de-boned it. I knew how to de-bone fish (well, a bit ;)) so i was the one to do it. Steph, meanwhile dipped the fish into the egg and cornstarch and the breadcrumbs. Vick was the one who fried the fish :)   Cool..the tempura was all done!! and plus, in fairness, it was GOOD! :*)  Rosy and Theres gave us some of their prok chops coz Nanay Lolet was a muslim and muslims are forbidden to eat pork.  Nanay Cynthia  also tells us that in St.Louise Village, all of them help each other. She tells us that they give each other food.  Yes they are a community.   We cook the porkchop. We re-cook the fried rice i bought and voila! we eat! bad thing was, Ate Rochelle and Charlo already left for school. They have half-day classes. but that's a good thing they go to school. But  Nanay Cynthia  tells us that most of the kids here finish only up to high school! That's why she always reminds us to study well and make do of our resources.   After we ate we went out and met up with the on the meeting place. The kids played games and we gave away prizes. These kids were so happy when they received such gifts. I never knew that a small piece of candy would make a child so happy. Probabaly because we were all so blessed with earthly materials in our lives, we often take them for granted and ask for more. Now, our lives only depend on earthly tangible materials..how depressing, right?  but anyways...we made our exit, did a prayer...bid farewell to our Nanays...The day is ended happy...with fulfillment. :)  Larissee

      this is the day we all realized how truly blessed we are...we just don't realize it 'til this foster family&nbsp;we will be with for a day comes to our&nbsp;aid and make us see how precious family is. how precious our everyday lives are.  ...I start the day happy, and i end it happy...this is the story...  I wake up, take a bath, eat breakfast, leave for school, wait till the awaiting doors of our classroom open.  we waited for a while and soon boarded the bus.  the next thing i knew was i was standing an alley with a muddy ground...sun shining so brightly that we were sweating right away, the scorching heat...houses that are crowded and can barely hold&nbsp;a population quite large, but it seems they still can manage to keep it as their own&nbsp;home. So...this is the  real world.     &nbsp; So i have been living in the dream world...not quite...  We were directed through an alley and we shortly found our foster families.   I, Steph and Vicky were assigned to  Nanay Cynthia . She was a very low-toned woman. She's a mother of 3 children. Ate Rochelle, 14 yrs old, 3rd yr hs. Charlo, grd 3 and little Ryan, 3 years old.  as we went inside their home, i wasn't more surprised...not that im criticizing them, but its the fact of life, it was a house (more of a "barung-barong"), crammed house...but still it was a home to them.  Nanay Cynthia  said sorry for their house's condition and told them the street was being reconstructed and their old house was on the way, so the gov't had to demolish their home.  yes...it was their way of life, no assured home...can be demolished by any higher official...they were used to that way of life...they could not complain... they just follow the authorities...but i guess its for their own good...(?).    &nbsp; back to reality..oops, this is reality.  we were offered a chair, actually, sa kahirapan nang buhay it was a plastic monobloc kiddie chair. They had a small dining table. It wasnt really a dining table, it was more of a study table good for 3 year old kids... yes...that is how hard life is in there...  we were introduced to Charlo, Ate Rochelle and Ryan.  We gave away the coloring book sand activity puzzles we bought for the kids. oh boy!&nbsp; when they saw it, their faces immediately had a big grin!...i never knew coloring books were so fascinating and a good find. well, for these children, it was their treasure...indeed... another man's trash is another man's treasure.    &nbsp; tbc. in part 2. too long..sorry. :)  Lari

      oh my...why is everyone sick? and it sucks you know.lol. but really...  yesterday, Angge had to go to the clinic because of her cough, and she had been absent on friday...:( and Miggy too...  why is everyone feel sooooooo sick??? i dunno..but even I have colds...*sniff sniff*  anyways...on to my  newest  obssesion...(go figure lol)  Ok...i may sound funny...but i am totally addicted to this Dan Brown novel called "The DaVinci Code". YES...it's all so mysterious and mind-boggling. Lots of car chases, decoding crypt messages, and a bit of romance at the end (just a bit? =D) . Yep, the first time i heard about this book was early this year, when my Mom and Dad was watching Fox News (american news channel available in Dream Satellite..sorry, no Sky cable :( ), the daily news anchors ala "Unang Hirit" [lol] were talking about this book which talks about the mysteries and adventures of an American Symbologist and a French cryptologist discovering the truths about the lost secrets if the Holy Grail. At first, i wasn't a real book freak on religious subjects...what more on the cheesy Grail part...lol. But on July 23, after the outreach, My Mom, saw the DaVinci Code on a National Bookstore bestselling list. She told me about how internationally acclaimed this book is. She wanted to buy it. Well, I encouraged her to buy it and finally got myself involved in it.lol =D We bought it (thank God for that) and when we were on our way home, i took a peek in the novel. I saw exciting parts and i was itchy to read the book right away!!  Fast forward to a week later, i was in the middle of the book and i can't seem to let go of the book! Ask Karen, Klarisse, Steph and a co-DaVinci reader Vicky. They see me all the time with the damn good novel! at dismissal, when Im headed to the canteen or the library, i dunno why, but i seem to bring Mona Lisa with me all the time!! yes...call me addicted and weird.  Now that i've finished the book, im itching to read the book AGAIN!...lol...but my Mom's turn to read it anyway...and while she's not reading it, i sneak and get the book from the shelf and read my fave part. The Romance part....hehe...yeah...i probabaly read that chapter a dozen times...sigh...a love story..well, not really, out of the 105 chapters it has, only Chapter 105 shows a romantic side, lol =D and a bit of Chapter 82...lol...ive memorized it...:) yeah...im fanatic...im addicted...im obssesive! lol  signing out, Larisse
