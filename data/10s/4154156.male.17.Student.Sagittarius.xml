      This is one of the often overlooked articels of Blessed Father Seraphim of Platina, but in my opinion it is one of his most important:  urlLink Introduction to  Blessed Paisius Velichkovsky: the Man Behind the Philokalia      Today the situation of Orthodoxy is rather different, and much worse, than it was in the time of the Elder Paisius. In place of the veneer of paganism and Latinism which never actually touched the heart of Orthodoxy, we have today a prevailing atmosphere of modernist heterodoxy and senseless "keeping up with the times" which has pierced the very heart of some Orthodox Churches so deeply that they will doubtless never recover, and their children are deprived of Orthodoxy without even knowing what they have lost. In place of the heavy hand of governmental bureaucracy, we see the far heavier hand of pseudo-Christian and pagan ways of life which are depriving Orthodox Christians of something which was almost untouched in the time of Blessed Paisius: Orthodox piety, the whole Christian way of life. And, to make this whole difficult situation virtually impossible, we are beset with self-styled reformers and revivers who neither know nor feel nor love what Orthodoxy is and would "restore" the faithful to the latest fashion of Protestant scholarship or piety.

      The intention of this blog is to serve as a medium for spreading traditionalist Orthodoxy and information pertaining to Orthodoxy.  Because of this purpose I have decided to dedicate it to Saint Kosmas of Aitolia.  Articles and my opinions on them are soon to follow!
