       My memory...  If only I could put away the past...   No..No..  I don't believe  in Love...  I never did and I never will...   Someone who caused me to think I was in love,... I was too naive...  To fall for your trap..  How silly I am...   No..No..  I m not another victim of love.   I am Kaili.  I am  different  from others.  I do not believe in Love.  I'm inhumane. I'm selfish.  I'm sick of self-love.  I keep all the love to myself. All was but a lie.  I'm foolish.but ure worse. DO you reali think i will really like you,you fool?   It was but a Game. A prank.  Fwahaha. I got you and everyone fooled.    I won.    +=Game Over=+

      itz 4:20pm . the rain outside is pourin down heavily . perfect weather for a mournin soul like me . my heart sinkz. i dun get it . why do i put up a false front infront of others ? i noe im not lidat . evryone tinks im happy-go-lucky . My parents tink tt im a cruel n untroubled person hu ish heartless..  BUT IM NOT !!  why do i not dare rto show my feelings ? i dont know how . I just cant. i dunoe why.  I feel terrible . Sometimes i dont even noe wad to write in my diary. going to a counsellor isnt anything better.  i do not want to escape reality , but, i cant face it too .  i reali dont noe myself. all i noe is tt im not happy. im a sad person .  does anyone noe te tears ive cried evrynite ?  do my parents noe how much i love dem  ? do dey noe te troubles i face ?  do dey noe dat im totally opposite frm wad dey judge me frm ... do dey noe tt i dont even haf tt little amount of cruelty in me to even kill an ant..?  i dunoe y cant i present myself carefully . itz probably cos im scared .  afraid to expose myself to evryone n let evry1 noe te real me . ttz probably y im owaes jokin.  sometimez even when im not, i pretend i do .  i dont lie. but sometimes, i conceal the truth too . but, i never do n i never will lie .    evry1 tinkz tt evryting of me is a joke . but itz not . evryting of me is merely concealed well .

      The road we walked back then is gone but I still walk along it anyway.  The snow quietly falls on the gentle slope, now I put your favorite flower in your room  even though I know it will never reach you.   when I remembered our unyielding promise  from last year's last day of snow, it began to melt,  and spill from my hands.   The snow quietly falls on the gentle slope, now I put your favorite flower in your room  even though I know it will never reach you.   As I remember you watching the snow from the window all alone,  I recall you through the window and give you one last kiss...   please, smile, stop your crying now... I'm always watching you from here.   The snow quietly falls on the gentle slope, now I put your favorite flower in your room  even though I know it will never reach you.  All over the city quietly colored white by the light, the last seasonal color you saw.  you shed tears, reality is cruel isn't it? the last seasonal color you saw.   The colors of you have finally disappeared with the four seasons the snow melts and flowers bloom on the street.  the "shades" you saw are melting.  the last day of snow this year  (one flower in the street, when I looked up to the sky,  the final snow was pouring from the palm of my hands)   Ain`t afraid to die ....          But would youu cryy ..?

      AH BENGS & AH LIANS, TONGUE-IN-CHEEK   Why the names 'Ah Beng' and 'AhLians' were chosen to represent this category of Singaporeans has never been very clear-except that AhBengs and AhLians are very common names for Singapore Chinese.   The people speak of them in a generally derisive tone and make jokes about the way AhBengs and AhLians dress, their 'weird' English(usually a mixture of Hokkien and Chinese and English), and the types of entertainment they go for.   Ahbengs like to use phrases like "Wat lah!" , "Ha Nah!" , "Oi!" ,"Happi Lah!" , "On ah!" , "Fight lah!" and "Not happy ah!". If you had noticed, almost every phrase had to end with a "lah!" or a "Nah!".   Furthermore, AhBengs and AhLians like to swear a lot. Phases like "Chxx-bye", "Nah Beh" ,"Ka Ni Na" and "Wa Lan Ah" are very commonly heard.   CHEENA " ..... we do not feel any affinity to the Chinese people ...... The cheena people working in Singapore are really such a crude lot."  ---penned by a 20something year old male Chinese Singaporean and brought up at the NATIONAL DAY RALLY 2001.   Don't get me wrong. Singaporean Chinese are great people. This profile is not meant to stir up any racial disharmony but to disassociate yourself with the Bengs and Lians of Singapore and cheenas. So chill and have fun!   Who I Want to Meet:  1. Non bengs and lians.  2. Non stupid people (cheenas).  3. People who have a sense of flair and fashion (bengs, lians and cheenas don't).    ________________________________________________________________   LOL ! i found tis on Friendster wahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha fwahahahahhahaha its soooo hilarious LOL !~~~~ *faints*    Nobody reads my blog anyway =( HEY IF URE READIN TIS NOW , Y WONT U JUZ LEAVE A COMMENT !?!?!?!?!?!?

      Queen's English is the English that is supposed to be spoken, and not mutated. Do you even know what "mutated' is? Well, unlike "cheena" twits who surround us day after day, breathing our precious air and contaminating innocent ears with their infantile acronyms whose linguistic capabilities barely exceed two syllable words, we normal people understand words beyond the kindergarten level and are able to SPEAK right and TYPE legibly, as opposed to "LyK DiS".       agh .

Fate had let it b tt i got to noe him for tt short period of time , but ive got no regrets . at least , i haf memories to look back to . these r juz part n parcel of life ,n , ive gone thru tis 4 times ? d 1st time was when my paternal grandfather died .. when i was 5 .. he doted on me alot .. d 2nd time was when i was 11 .. when my dear shirley left me ... d 3rd time .. was when i lost a fren in sec sch ..... d 4th time .. was when Jq stepped out of my life .... but .. its ok , if therez reali fate between us , one day we'll definitely meet again . He's someone whom i will always remember , He's someone whom i admire alot , He taught me how to love , cuz he was the first person i ever liked . from tt , i learnt tt love is pain , love is miserable , especially unrequited love :) But i know , he's not te one , becuz now , Ive found the one who's meant for me , n we spend each day happily together :)   Dear Shirley ,  on o6 June 2oo4 , there was d'J Party{Japanese Culture Day} @ Faber house Park , a part of Singapore Street Festival .
