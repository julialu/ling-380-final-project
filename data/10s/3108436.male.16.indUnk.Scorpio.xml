She often ‘adorn’ my dinner or lunch with foreign objects like plastic and………….I still remember that last month when I found two small stones shape like bubbles inside my bottle.  I almost swallowed it………….dunno what will happen to me if I didn’t spit it out immediately.  Besides that, she often grinds at night……..no, I shall say midnight

      Fever is not an illness:  It is simply a raised body temperature,and usually a sign of some form of infection.  But what should you do about it???   "Is it important to keep warm when you have a temperature?" You should not allow yourself to get too cold.  On the other hand, there is no need to pile blankets on the bed or heat the room to oven temperature.  Rest, be as comfortable as tou can, and your body will do what is needed.    "When I have temperature, I shiver one minute and sweat profusely the next.  Why is this?" In a fever, the temperature not only goes up, it swings up and down much more than usual.  As it is on its way up, people experience shivering chills, which may be so intense as to cause uncontrollable shaking attacks, called rigors.  As soon as the temperature starts to fall again, there is a lot of sweating.

        A Blonde’s Brain At Work     A blonde, a brunette, and a redhead all work at the same office for a female boss who always goes home early.  "Hey, girls," says the brunette, "let's go home early tomorrow. She'll never know."  So the next day, they all leave right after the boss does. The brunette gets some extra gardening done, the redhead goes to a bar, and the blonde goes home to find her husband having sex with the female boss! She quietly sneaks out of the house and returns at her normal time.  "That was fun," says the brunette. "We should do it again sometime."  "No way," says the blonde. "I almost got caught."   Hahahahahahahaha……………

       A Horoscope For The Workplace     ASTROLOGY: tells us about you and your future simply by your birthday. The Chinese Zodiac uses the year of your birth. Demographics tell us what you like, dislike, whom you vote for, what you buy, and what you watch on TV. Well, the Corporate Zodiac goes a step further: simply by your job title, people will have you all figured out...  MARKETING: You are ambitious yet stupid. You chose a marketing degree to avoid having to study in college, concentrating instead on drinking and socializing, which is pretty much what your job responsibilities are now. Least compatible with Sales.   SALES: Laziest of all signs, often referred to as "marketing without a degree," you are also self-centered and paranoid. Unless someone calls you and begs you to take their money, you like to avoid contact with "customers" so you can "concentrate on the big picture." You seek admiration for your golf game throughout your life.   TECHNOLOGY: Unable to control anything in your personal life, you are  instead content to completely control everything that happens at your workplace. Often even YOU don't understand what you are saying, but who the hell can tell?! It is written that the geeks shall inherit the Earth.   ENGINEERING: One of only two signs that actually studied in school, it is said that ninety percent of all personal ads are placed by engineers. You can be happy with yourself: your office is typically full of all the latest "ergodynamic" gadgets. However, we all know what is really causing your "carpal tunnel"...   ACCOUNTING: The only other sign that studied in school, you are mostly immune from office politics. You are the most feared person in the organization; combined with your extreme organizational traits, the  majority of rumors concerning you say that you are completely insane.   HUMAN RESOURCES: Ironically, given your access to confidential information, you tend to be the biggest gossip within the organization. Possibly the only other person that does less work than marketing, you are unable to return any calls today because you have to get a haircut,  have lunch, and mail a letter!   MIDDLE MANAGEMENT/DEPARTMENT MANAGEMENT/"TEAM LEADS": Catty, cut-throat, yet completely spineless, you are destined to remain at your current job for the rest of your life. Unable to make a single decision you tend to measure your worth by the number of meetings you can schedule for yourself. Best suited to marry other "Middle Managers," as everyone in your social circle is a "Middle Manager."   SENIOR MANAGEMENT: Catty, cut-throat, yet completely spineless, you are destined to remain at your current job for the rest of your life. Unable to make a single decision you tend to measure your worth by the number of meetings you can schedule for yourself. Best suited to marry other "Senior Managers," as everyone in your social circle is a "Senior Manager."   CUSTOMER SERVICE: Bright, cheery, positive, you are a fifty-cent cab ride from taking your own life. As a child very few of you asked your parents for a little cubicle for your room and a headset so you could pretend to play "Customer Service." Continually passed over for promotions, your best bet is to sleep with your boss.

       JOKES   New Rules For Employment    SICKNESS AND RELATED LEAVE: We will no longer accept a doctor statement as proof of sickness. If you are able to go to the doctor, you are able to come to work.   SURGERY: Operations are now banned. As long as you are an employee here, you need all your organs. You should not consider removing anything. We hired you intact. To have something removed constitutes a breach of employment.   BEREAVEMENT LEAVE: This is no excuse for missing work. There is nothing you can do for dead friends, Relatives or coworkers. Every effort should be made to have non-employees attend to the arrangements. In rare cases, where employee involvement is necessary, the funeral should be scheduled in the late afternoon. We will be glad to allow you to work through your lunch hour and subsequently leave one hour early, provided your share of the work is done enough.   YOUR OWN DEATH: This will be accepted as an excuse. However, we require at least two weeks notice as it is your duty to train your own replacement.   RESTROOM USE: Entirely too much time is being spent in the restroom. In the future, we will follow the practice of going in alphabetical order. For instance, all employees whose names begin with ''''''''''''''''A'''''''''''''''' will go from 8:00 to 8:10, employees whose names begin with ''''''''''''''''B'''''''''''''''' will go from 8:10 to 8:20 and so on. If you''''''''''''''''re unable to go at your allotted time, it will be necessary to wait until the next day when your turn comes again. In extreme emergencies employees may swap their time with a coworker. Both employees'''''''''''''''' supervisors in writing must approve this exchange. In addition, there is now a strict 3-minute time limit in the stalls. At the end of three minutes, an alarm will sound, the toilet paper roll will retract, and the stall door will open.   PAYCHECK GUIDE: The following helpful guide has been prepared to help our employees better understand their paychecks:   Item Amount Gross pay $1,222.02 Income tax $244.40 Outgo tax $45.21 State tax $11.61 Interstate tax $61.10 County tax $6.11 City tax $12.22 Rural tax $4.44 Back tax $1.11 Front tax $1.16 Side tax $1.61 Up tax $1.08 Down tax $1.14 Tic-Tacs $1.98 Thumbtacks $3.93 Carpet tacks $0.98 Stadium tax $0.69 Flat tax $8.32 Surtax $2.23 Ma''''''''''''''''am tax $1.23 Corporate tax $2.60 Parking fee $5.00 F.I.C.A. $81.88 T.G.I.F.

Hundreds more fires were being set even as the thick cloud of smoke already severely reduced visibility across the region. Officials warned that the level of pollution was getting dangerously high and unhealthy. The fires are being set primarily by plantation owners, taking advantage of the current dry season, to clear forested lands and to burn away the surface peat in swamp areas.

      Just came back from a visit to IMR(Institute Medical Research) and FRIM(???) organized by the Mathematics Society.   Firstly, we went to IMR and we saw a lot of plants for the use of medical purpose or herbs as well.  When we reach the herbs garden……………..the first thing we have done was searching for Kacek Fatimah and Tongkat Ali.  Of course, we have had asked for the ways to consume it………..For Tongkat Ali, we just have to boil its root in water and drink it.  The attendant emphasized that one cannot simply consume its powder due to human’s kidney cannot filter those tiny substances.  Then, before we left the garden the attendant gave Miss Phoon an Madam Chan three pieces of  ‘Sambung Nyawa’ for its use of lower the blood pressure and ease migraine.  Miss Phoon and Madam Chan seems to be very curious to those herbs as I saw them discussing and talking about how their grandmother use herbs to ease the illness all along the way…………And they said they wants to get it planted at home for their parent’s sake.  Since the plant is so good at lower the blood pressure…………..we devoured it without washing it……………….THIS WAS MY FIRST TIME TO EAT LEAF……………Impossible to imagine.   At the museum, we have saw well-preserved rats, squirrel, birds, cats, baby tiger, and snakes….There are various types of snakes with weird names………I can remember a one, it is ‘Ular Kucing Bergigi Anjing’……..really cannot imagine why those people is so creative as they created this name for this type of snakes………….. After this, we went for jungle tracking at FRIM.  We can see Miss Phoon’s bag can accommodate lots of things although it is small…………..just like Doraemon’s magic bag.  We saw a lot of giant trees such as Cengal(the hardest tree), Meranti, Kapur,..……..Besides giant trees we saw giant ants……………the guide has had played with the approximately 3 centimeters long giant worker ants………………Think of why was he acted so brave………..this was because that is just a worker ant and not a soldier ant……….If so, then he will sure die in pieces………  We have had climbed up to 1000 feets of height …………..Almost dead………TTP and I have to beware of stepping into “shits”(mud) along the route.  We also saw the IKAN NAGA with its broad-wide mouth……almost 15+ centimeters wide…………….and its long is approximately three of the length of our school desk………………………….We bought a long piece of bread to feed the IKAN NAGA………………….All of us have done it but only TTP.  He has had fed himself with the ‘ROTI’(please keep your hair up TTP).  Along the journey…………..I really cannot stand of the attitude of DS.

      Almost get bombarded by Ambika today……..U know?? 4 periods!!……….It was totally a torturing lesson…………………What a senseless woman…….she finished a chapter plus pages of ‘The pearl’ by using 4 periods……….(please note that there is only a chapter++)………………………………she asked me to act as the fubsy doctor and Jesus as the main character of ‘The Pearl’--- Kino……………Then, I started to wonder…..she hoped us to act exactly (I think is just 50% from exact) like the story…………but why she chose Jesus……….he is not as man as Kino…and why she chose me to act as the FUBSY doctor………………Then, her only 50% is vanished ………………..because I’m only 1% of the fatty doctor………hahaha!!! And my voice box is not covered by lipids…………so I can’t groan like a sow.(in Chinese is MU CHU). Miss Lee also came in to our class………..to substitute the “Giraffe” ‘s class…….She had a lot to talk………………….CEASELESS…………………….very noisy…………just wanna choke her……………CYS is the most innocent during that moment…………… After school, I went to 7eleven to buy Chunky Kit-Kats. The guy at the counter is mad….just like his grandmother gives birth……he talks a lot to me.  Well, I’m not very patient to listen to all his bullshits …..just wanna leave quickly because W12 is coming soon.  Next time when I see him in the shop, I will not step in…………..if not he got a lot to talk to………….  BUG BUG BUG BUG BUG!!! Just wanna shout like a bug…….OH! BUGGIN’ YOU!!!

      YEEEEEEE!!! How the hell to put those smelly papayas into my delicate mouth........I hate those smells especially while the papayas has been in the tupperware for hours..............Those papayas is soft and emit smells ...put it into my mouth is just like eating shits..........I always try to evade but what to do, my father used to force me to eat......................Really cannot imagine the stench from those rotten papayas in a container.  HF said she has had done before this experiment when she was in primary school..........I think she screamed loudly like a squirrel at that moment while she smells the bad stench...... I REALLY HATE PAPAYAS!!!!

      I did a stupid thing today…………..It rained heavily from the time approximately 1.30 p.m. to *.**p.m…………and we (HF,MF,SHY&MRMY)  have our BM tuition at 1.45p.m. at TY’s house…………………Feel like lucky because both HF&MF got their own umbrella (MRMY&SHY do not have a one)…so that HF&MF share an umbrella and MRMY&SHY share a one………..Along the journey to TY’s house, SHY is the one who holds the umbrella……….just like the umbrella is for his own.  He left only a few inches for me to refuge…………..Although I know I’m not big-size but how CRUEL is he………And also there is a lot of lower paces(holes) that filled with the rain water……and I just step into it………..not saying that I’m senseless but it is because I’m busying fighting for my right to have the half side of the little umbrella……. One funny thing is…….if you are one who walks beside HF……you can hear screaming sound (AAAAAA!!!) comes out from her voice box.  Once a lorry or a motorcycle or a car as well cross through……….keep screaming AAA! AAA! AAA!   Hahahaha When I reached TY’s house I’m totally wet……….when I turn back my shoes….I saw water dripping out……………it was the same while I squeeze my stocking…………HF screamed frequently while NAZRI talking some *** stuff…….LIKE squirrel………..  ONE thing weird is FSJ kept his stocking in his pocket….with the reason--- It will make the stocking to dry……………..TRY to think……is it logic…..

      WEIRD WEIRD WEIRD !!! Don't know why I am having this feelings........ I found that my house is a bit of noisy ...not a good place for me to study in peace....this may due to the conflict arose within my parents and my eldest sister.....she just got her scholarship to pursue for chemical engineering but...she is reluctant to go...and also hatred to go....I can see this from her emotion and temper......she said she wants to continue her FORM 6 and she said she prefer bio compare to others....she wants her career to be relevant to BIO stuff.....but my parents disagreed that.....then sometime there are some intense quarrel......

      Today is my first day to enter the crowd…………….To enter the distinguish KASTURI tuition center.  Well, every thing is just nice but just a little bit problems dealing with the enrolment procedures.  I hate the little fubsy MALAY woman who sat like a bitch or somehow like a sow at the registering counter.  Want to die then go !!!  After P.Hong class, I went home by taking a LRT ride.  Damn, people were as much as mountains.  When the door of the LRT cubicle open, people who wants to leave pushing those who wants to enter the cubicle.  Luckily, I have had hold something. If not, they will push me out.  At that moment, no one is going to tolerate with you!!

Really, ……..and I have had to pretend as I don’t know everything…………..still have to show my happy face to him, still have to take his car to school………………..He has done something , something that is extremely cheap………makes dirty my house …………….. But I wonder why I still have to pretend………..to give my respect to him……… Damn! My bloody lewd uncle......He deserves a poke!@!
