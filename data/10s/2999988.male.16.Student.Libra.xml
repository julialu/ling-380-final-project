       Karma   Does it exist?  You do something bad to someone else, does it come back to haunt you?  Or what about if you do something good, does something good equally happen?  What about the theory that if you are doing something good, someone else is recieving pain or something bad, or vice versa.

       The Rule of Like-Like?   You like someone, however you just know or having a feeling that they don't like you. However, you know that someone likes you, but theres just no way you could like them for whatever reason.  I've noticed this in a few relationships really, very...weird.

       The Internet   Why's it got such a bad rep?  It's good to use for reference, but if you like it too much, or spend too much time on it it's bad?  It's ok to be online once in a while, but not on for more than 2 hours a day?

      ...the thick of exams have finally sourrounded all year eleven students in England and Wales. Almost Halfway through every major subject, things are looking sticky, and I'm not talking about the palm of jo's hand.  The lack of entries could be put down to revision, however that would be a tick of such great proportions, like a president not actually winning the election, but is president anyway...but that would never happen....  Not much has happened, I'm still lurking and Jo is on her fourth boyfriend of the year. While bets are on for the length of the relationship, the odds of Jo going out with two people at the same time during the year are at a good 10-1. ;)  Ah, gotta love Jo ^_^
