       This post has nothing to do with anime (hence the title) I just wanted to celebrate becoming a Super Star ( urlLink The Sims ) It didn't take as long as I expected but it sure was hard work!! *whew* Out of all the Sims expansion packs, I most enjoyed  urlLink Makin Magic  and  urlLink Livin Large   But after looking at screen shots from  urlLink The Sims 2  I've sort of lost intrest in the first sims....anyways, I've posted a few screen shots from the sims, their kind of cute actually...like my  urlLink ghost cat  (yes I killed my sim's cat) for some strange reason...It's using the litter box.... -__-;; Making Magic has the coolest options, like you can make spells that change the  urlLink apperance  of your sim, you can also make a spell that will give you lots of  urlLink treasures  and my favorite, being abducted by  urlLink aliens  (Livin' Large Expansion Pack) ^_^
