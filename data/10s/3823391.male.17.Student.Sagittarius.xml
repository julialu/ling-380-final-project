      Yes, Mike finally found the relationship between the two.  My ANMATH2 (Mathematical Analysis) professor, Dr. Tristian Reyes told us that "Math is like sex"  If math is like sex because of reasons such as...  --

      I've always baffled upon the weirdness behind Computer Science subjects. The fact that we have to simplify our solutions in some analytical and mathematical manner, yet we stray away from the rules of basic arithmetic. And the funnier fact is, we have this long solution then end up cancelling 90% of the things we write down on paper through using a series of rules and axioms.  A waste of ink and paper.  Come to think of it, I never really thought that Computer Science would focus on the algorithmic madness. Hell no. I was one of those naive programmer wannabes that thought, "Lookie here! I'm going to program! I'm going to create games! And I'm going to be filthy rich!". And now I think, "Why am I taking up these stupid courses that force me to write long solutions and let me erase all of them to come up of a simplified one?"  Though it looks like it, this post is not going to be rant on saving trees and ink. Rather, I want to prove a point here.  Moving on, my views on Computer Science did not fully clear up until this term came. I didn't know that Computer Science was more than programming applications and thinking of solutions. Rather, optimization of one's code is the key to an efficient program. So I guess we really had to go through boolean algebra, push-down automaton and resolution... I think I just sunk myself into (Gokong)hell and got myself to burn and rot amidst all the craziness of algorithm formulation and optimization.  What comes worse is learning a new programming language in (more or less) a month and create a project from it afterwards. Definately that's killing me more. Who would've thought that 8088 Assembly Programming and PROLOG would be totally different paradigms? One talked about doing a primitive, step-by-step approach while the other thrived on logic and recursion.  Of course, a stupid person like me didn't expect that.  Now, I'm doomed to get my set of failing grades... And I guess I'm stuck with this type of shit. I didn't know it was going to be this hard, and I guess I have to expect for worse.  I bit off more than I can chew. I was blinded by my dreams and now I have to pay the price.  Now that I'm in this infinite loop of Computer Science agression, I guess I have to make the most of what I have.  And yes, I am not giving up.
