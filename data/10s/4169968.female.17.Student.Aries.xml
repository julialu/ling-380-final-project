      Warning: If you are American or are planning to become one.. do not read any further... thank you for your understanding.   working in a land full or morons can be quite irritating over time... ...and as you should all know... ...america is led by an idiot.. and therefore the little miniature versions of him are all morons as well... America is a land full of Little Miniature Bushe's... well.. except for me.. and a few of my mates... it's quite annoying... and I feel alone.. I'm quite sleep deprived, and am currently getting by on mentos breath mints, and chocolate milk... oh, and i also think that whoever decided to have time zones.. is a bloody MORON! and the night shift.. that was a terrible idea if i've ever heard of one.. but whoever thought of mixing chocolate with milk.. well *praises the ground they walk on* who needs sleep! i have MENTOS! :
