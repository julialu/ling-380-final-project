      wow so i just noticed its been forever since my last post...whoops. i've kinda been occupied lately. not with anything too important...just hanging out. i think i've been swimming every single day for the last week or more. today i decided to take a break from the water...since i already have plans to go tomorrow again! i've realized lately how much i love oregon and the rivers around here. its absolutely gorgeous. i spent a week in indiana/illinois area and its so flat and dry and ugly...everywhere we went there were buildings and dry grass and very few trees. i was talking with someone there from arizona and he was saying that trees cost like a thousand dollars there...he was kidding and everything, but it just shows that trees aren't common at all in arizona and that sucks! i was also talking to another kid from arizona last week and i was telling him i was going to the river to go swimming and he said that they don't have any rivers near him at all! that would suck so bad...only swimming in pools would suck, lol.  so today i'm hopefully going to spend some time putting my room back together. while i was up in portland on the yearbook retreat my dad put wood floors in my room. they look really good, but i miss having carpet. so everything that was in my room is now in the living room...so i guess i kinda have two rooms right now, hehe. i have so much crap to get rid of too...i threw away all my socks without matches! hehe it was pretty exciting...let me tell ya. lol so sorry it was so long since i've written if anyone even reads this...lol. see ya around everyone

       so many things have been happening lately. little things, but i've just been thinking about how little things can change something so much. i was watching the movie butterfly effect and the chaos theory says that something as small as the flutter of a butterfly's wings can ultimately cause a typhoon halfway around the world. its a cool quote for me because i've always thought that all of our actions effect someone or something. even just the tiniest things can change what you were thinking and that can change other actions...maybe i'm not making sense.  one thing in particular has been changing a lot for me and i have to say it makes me really happy. i'm not sure how everything is changing but i just know that it already has and hopefully will continue to.

       i'm a little upset right now. i grabbed a banana for breakfast and came over to the computer to enjoy it while i check my email but no, it had to be brown. and mushy. so now my stomach is growling at me but i thought i would take a few minutes to let my fans know what i've been up to! well yesterday morning i went with my youth group over to beautiful bandon-by-the-sea. did you know that is the actual name of the town? i thought that it's kind of a silly name for a town...but thats just me. and i went to the cheese factory and oddly enough, ate some cheese. um we just hung out in bandon for the day tho, i buried my feet in the sand and i also buried katie's, emily's, and cayla's feet too. and if that doesn't sound exciting enough, we then played hearts while we froze. then after i got back i went over to tyler's house and we built a fire and watched the lightning. did anyone else see it? it was really cool, it lit up the whole sky! but now i'm off to work in the ticket booth and the pepsi game. and actually i havent gotten ready yet so i better be doing that. more later...

       i'm not very philosophical and i'm usually not a deep thinker so just thinking of topics to write about might be tough, so for the nights when my brain doesn't want to be creative, i'm just going to answer these questions i have. sometimes you, my many readers ;), may be lucky enough to read something worth reading, but until then...  the other night i was talking with a friend about reincarnation and i don't really believe in it but it got me to thinking, if i had a choice to be reincarnated as any animal, what would i be?  and i decided...a cat. and i would be like super cat, so i could go get in fights with christina's mean cat. and i might just have to run the poor kitty out of town, hehe.  but seriously, i really dislike cat's so that's definitely not what i'd want to be for 9 stinkin' lives. but i really think i would be a bird. i know it's a cheesy answer but i would love to fly! and i'm pretty sure i would live on the notre dame campus and i would chase the squirrels. which actually happens...its really hilarious to see.  and if i were a bird i would poop on the mean people's cars. God would whisper to me which people were talking crap about him and i would take care of their cars for him. hehe i bet that happens too. maybe if i stopped sinning birds wouldn't poop on my car anymore. maybe i'll try that sometime, lol.  but answer the question in the comments k?

       i've been looking for a journal for awhile now...sometimes i write in a notebook, or my diary that i've had since like 3rd grade but i thought i'd give this a try. its a little public but i've got nothing to hide i suppose. enjoy!
