      Man...my mum's gonna go for an operation tomorrow, I hope so much that she'll be fine, and I would pray with all my heart when she is in the operations room. I can't stop thinking about it, I hope she gets fine soon and life can get back to normal, right now its so hard to even concentrate. I would like to thank a very special friend who, encouraged me that my mum would be fine, and that I wouldn't have to worry too much. Thank you with all my heart, i'll remember your birthday for sure!   RO Thoughts Today  Well, ain't nothing much to write on, just a quick tip before I logoff to do my homework (yeah some leftovers).   Tanking  Knights are good tankers, if they are used correctly, but Crusaders are better tankers overall as they have more defensive skills and more HP to accomodate their already enhanced defense. The only way to tank well however, is to either get a priest to support you, or get those sickening hard to get cards for shields. The -30% Damage really helps when you're tanking cuz every HP counts, especially for a knight as the only way they can completely avoid an attack is either dodging it or using Auto-Counter. How do knights use shields? Use a +10 4s Pike, slot it with cards and there, use a shield on the other hand. Unknown to many RO players, there are actually 1 handed spears, most of which aren't really powerful, but the pike is an exception at +10 with really freaky cards (there's a reason Gravity made this weapon ya know). Overall, the Crusader is a better tanker than the knight, but the knight is more offensive based. Aha, did I miss out another class that tanks well? Of course! The assassin! These buggers save the team when the knights and crusaders are knocked out at the front of a battle especially when facing strong mobs. Perfect dodge sins are really nimble flies, they can dodge just about anything, with a priest supporting their tanking is superb, most of the time even outdoing the knight or crusader. Take note however, the perfect dodge sin has horribly weak attacks and hardly any skills to accompany him in his journey. Then again, he makes up for it with his mad dodging.

      Man, why did I wanna start a blog? an online diary that I can write in everyday cuz im almost online everyday? Well anyways, time to get started on this diary, i'll start my write up about my life everyday!  Today, Man, school blows, so much homewoek hand in due tomorrow, i don't think i can finish it all on time, man they gotta change the study policy here in Singapore, we need maths for everywhere we go -.-||... well, life's tough, we all gotta live life to the full, imma get into some trouble and start the thrill of teachers scoldin me, cya sometime soon!  -Mel   Ragnarok Thoughts  For those of you who dunno what RO is, its an MMORPG made my Gravity, a Korean company that makes games. www.ragnarokonline.com I'll be writing on this game as I go along...  The Real fun of RO, is probably coming up with whacky builds to rock people's minds and freak them out. I mean, whats the fun of playing a game that has everyone the same for a certain class, it'd be boring wouldn't it, so peeps started coming up wid weird builds like the Agility Knight, or the Vitality Assassin, theres even the Meelee Priest build! Looking at all these builds im inspired to play RO, where every character is different and they all have their strengths and weaknesses, working together while improving the strengths and covering up the weaknesses, thats the true fun of ro, well at least to me.

      Woohoo! Aight I havent been writing for a while cuz i've been busy with stuff, but now i'm back and I feel extremely happy today cuz I finally found the courage to talk to a girl whom i've been liking for 6 months. Though it only lasted a mere 10 seconds I enjoyed every moment of it, I was so afraid that I might stumble with my words but I didn't! Though I feel that she's been trying to talk to me but she can't find the courage to, it might just be wishful thinking on my part, who'd like me anyways? :P Well I felt that way, I always try to talk to her but I get afraid at the last moment. Well I finally did it, thanks to my good friend Keong who gave me a counselling session yesterday. Keong is like an older brother to me, hes 4 years older than me and I go to him for advice. Well thats all for today, boy do I feel good! n_n! -Mel     Ragnarok Thoughts For Today:   Hmm, I haven't been playing Ragnarok for quite some time now, but I still have some leftover knowledge that might actually help? O_o Anyways, let's talk about pvping, probably the most common interest for professional players who have gotten all of the game's secrets and have all their equipment ready. What better thing to do than fight monster A.I? Fight another player's intellect. In pvp, the main 3 rock paper scissors classes are considered, with the rest being classes out of the original 3.
