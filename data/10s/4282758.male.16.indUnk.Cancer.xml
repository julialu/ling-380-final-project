             In Athens,the XXVIII Olympic Games continued       again today. Michael Philips has more than just lived up to pre-Olympic expectations and even with B-14s parked in thier training facilities, the Iraqi soccer team is shocking the world.       Meanwhile, on the home front, in a surprising change of events earlier today, president-hopeful John Kerry launched a series of attacks against President Bush accusing him of hiding behing supporters whom have been trying to discredit Kerry's decorated Vietnam Service.      "He wants them to do his dirty work," proclaimed Senator Kerry.    It's only anybody's guess who's doing the senator's laundry these days.     In Hayward, California it's just another day.
