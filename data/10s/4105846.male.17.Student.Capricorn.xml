      Am I honest? Am I true? Am I good enough for you? Am I brave? Am I bright? Am I the one you dream of at night? Am I cruel? Am I quiet? Am I your love like you said? Am I serious? Am I funny? I am.. I am.. I am.. Me.

      I sit here waiting for you with nothing to do and no one to talk to being alone brings out the words that help make up this song  waiting for a message from you telling me were finished at last only the radio keeps me entertained eventhough I dont like the song  Im so bored I think of things but I cant think of anything right now just the excitement of seeing you of seeing you... of seeing you  I can see you walking toward me you and your perfect personality I can smell the scent of your perfume from here ain't love a funny thing? just seeing you is a big deal for me everything you do is wonderful to me  Then I woke up from a daydream I realized that youre not here im back here in this place so boring waiting for you... waiting for you

      by: The Juliana Theory   You're the words that come out easy, And I am speechless at best. Your star it seems to shine above the rest. You're the face before the cameras, The smile i'd like to earn. The closest thing to perfect, In a hollywood to burn. You're the beauty that is deeper, Than eyes can merely see. The closest thing to perfect. But the farthest thing from me.  I'd love to be, The shoulder that you cry on. I'd love to be, The friend you call when things are great.  I'd love to be, The shoulder that you cry on. I'd love to be, The friend you call when things are great.  You're the dream that hasn't ended, And i'm still anxious for rest. Your words they seem to hang above my head. You're the bud before the flower, Unfurls into full bloom. Captivating beauty, But it maybe all too soon. You're the song that writes a story, But leaves alot to read. The closest thing to perfect, But the farthest thing from me.  I'd love to be, The shoulder that you cry on. I'd love to be, The friend you call when things are great.  I'd love to be, The shoulder that you cry on. I'd love to be, The friend you call when things are great.  And like I really deserve a chance to, Sit across the table, And tell you that I think you're wonderful. And I think you're something special. I guess this is my only chance to, Say I wish I knew you, Because I'm sure you're wonderful, If I'd get to know you.

      Too many times when I said were done, but youll cry when you think im gone, so now ill give you a chance to make up. Feeling the teardrops falling in my shirt, that's when the feeling start to hurt, so now ill give you a chance to make up.  This isn't the first time I gave you a chance, because I believe in this thing called romance, so, I will give you another chance to make up. Weve been through a lot in the past, the memories are so vast, so, I will give you another chance to make up.  This will be your last second chance. To have an attitude that is enhanced. This will be your last second chance. I'll say be careful in advance.

      Feeling guilty with what I have done wish I didn't do it coz now youre gone but i tried to stay strong and make sure I wouldnt run i didn't know this day would ever come  Ive tried to change my whole self for you because I know what I feel is true I tried to forget the pain in my heart that's bruised but I always knew that I could never do this to you  I now know what it feels like to have a heart thats broken I say that my heart is numb, but I can still hear your heart calling begging me to come back because its me whom youve fallen but I keep on saying no, and I keep on shaking  I always think about why do you have to be like that all the things that I have said you didn't understand Even if I explain thouroughly, you still wouldn't try to comprehend Even simple things you still don't try to understand.  I want you to remember that even if we couldn't be together, id still be here like what I have promised as your lover. Nothing would change, we would stay this way forever, to hurt you as a friend is what I would never do. Never.

      Awake, through the years it takes to see you  'Til I almost lose my mind 'Cause I'll never be alright And I'm sorry you had to see this  But I'm such a mess And I never could forget   I'm scared I'll miss the way we use to talk And if its all forever lost dont wanna know I'm scared that you're the one that got away And i want you here with me Tonight, will never come    I'm scared I'll miss the way we use to talk And if its all forever lost dont wanna know I'm scared that you're the one that got away And i want you here with me Tonight, will never come

      by: dashboard confessional  You called to say you wanted out. Well, I can't say I blame you now. Sometimes you've got to fall before you're found out. Well thanks for waiting this long to show yourself.   Cause now that I can see you, I don't think you're worth a second glance.   So much for all the promises you made, they served you well and now you're gone and they're wasted on me. So much for your endearing sense of charm, it served you well and now it's gone and you're wasted on me.  You called to say you wanted out. Well, I can't say I blame you now.

      by: jaythegame   I can't explain the way I'm feeling, these things in my head are so confusing. Why should I suffer from all these? You always give me a headache, whenever its my time you try to take. Can you please stop coz I'm suffering.  You never listen to everything I say, that's why I didn't insist that you'd stay. Making comments about the madness that we've been through. You tried to ruin my life, and all along you thought it was right. So now I'm staying away from you!  Why can't I stand seeing you like this crying and screaming your apologies while I don't believe in any of these because you and your words are full of infidelities!!

       I noticed you smile at me,   of all the people smiling   it's yours that gave me a slight bump   in the head,   and maybe in the heart.   You gave me a slight bump   in the head and in the heart   when I noticed you smile at me.      We've been friends for a long time,   and that span of the time   we've known each other very well   and I know that it's selfish to say   "could we be more than friends?"      I know it's selfish   but could we give it a try?      So please,   knowing you turned to loving you   and I can't help but to try! To Try!!      To try! I can't help but to try!      To Try! To Try!   It wouldn't hurt to try!      It may be risky,   it may be fruitful,   it may be dreadful,   but can we please try      To risk our friendship,   a new relationship!      I know we can work it out!!!!

       Welcome to  Mangyanan ! Bago to ah! Blogspot blogspot. Kung anu ano lang naman ilalagay ko dito e! Natatakot ako kasi tinext ako ni Pauline, na isa kong close friend at nagkakilala kami nung third year high school, kanina at sinabi niya na kasama ako sa 18 serenades sa debut niya. Kakanta ako ng kantang dinededicate ko sa kanya. WOW! Ako kumanta? Sa harap ng madla? This wont be the first time but I remember the last time I sang a song onstage..Fuckin' shitty man! I forgot the lyrics of the fuckin song! it's ok naman maganda naman ung pagtugtog ko e. Pwede kaya ung 'The Closest Thing' ng Juliana Theory? Pwede na un! Hala andami ko na nasabi at dadamihan ko pa. May problem ako dito sa blogspot..Hindi gumagana sa Mozilla ko itong crap na to. Hindi naman ako gumagamit ng Internet Explorer dahil crap tong browser na to. Napipilitan tuloy ako. Parang Zorpia ba tong blogspot? Pangit ung Zorpia e. Crap din! Buti naman naayos na ung PS2 namen kasi hindi ako makapaglaro ng Spiderman 2!!!Nakatulog si Joanne ng maaga. Hindi ko naman siya masisisi dahil may pasok pa siya bukas. Naiintindihan ko un mom tulog ka lang jan at ingat ka ha. hindi ako galit. Ayun, andami kong prublema noh? Makikinig nalang ako ng 'Dashboard Confessional,' which is my favorite band. Sige hanggang dito muna..
