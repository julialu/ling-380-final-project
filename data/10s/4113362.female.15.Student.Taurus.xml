I'm so happy, yet I have no reason to be. Everything in my life is falling down and I'm just sitting here, watching it fall, and smiling, because I'm numb. Whatever. Saturday we're supposedly going to CR.  That should be exciting, hopefully I get to hang out with Curtis but I highly doubt that. The percentage is probably sitting at about .4   "I wonder where you are, please don't come around tonight 'cuz I can't stand to see you and I don't want to fight. Give me one more drink and I swear I think I'll be ready to make the same mistakes again, with you. I finally figured out that you're not coming back, I'm not going anywhere." -Effing AWESOME band. I found it whilest searching for a song that wasn't by them..but was by Dashboard Confessional.   Everything is so good. Everything is so happy..being happy is so much easier then being sad. I love it. It's good. You're all such sweethearts :-P lol  "I want to be what you've always needed. I don't want another pretty face, I don't want just anyone to hold, I don't want my love to go to waste. I want you and your beautiful soul"    Yeah. I'm thinking about burning a CD. Cd's are good. Curtis is also good. I'd like to let everyone know that. Especially you mr curtis, you have the ability to make everything seem okay again. And when I'm really really bitchy, and you're saying nice things..and I say Whatever, whatever. And you think I'm not listening, and you think you're not helping. You are, im not even really..that upset anymore. I just..am too stuborn to admit it. And if I really hated you as much as I said I did all those times, I would have left.      I've concluded numerous amounts of things in the past couple days. My writing has gone downhill a horrible amount. I need to start writing again.  I also concluded that everything in the world doesn't need to be a contest, but with me, it is. Which is sad, and needs to change.  So yes.  On a lighter note; (Ohh...it's a pun)  I lost 7 pounds. Because I'm cool. You guys all said, "Your diet wont work." Well it worked. You lose. :) I definitely win.   That is all.

We swam in the ocean..the ocean full of stars.....The boys came :) The boys are nice. The boys make me laugh with their theme song music and their duets. They're either really, really good at being players, and really badly need to get laid, or they're really,  really  nice guys.  But either way is fine..because if they're nice guys...good, we got ourselves some more decent friends. And otherwise is just what I assumed the whole time.   I decided we need a car. Cars are good, so are trucks. They make me smile. It's good to be able to say, "Hey, let's go to the beach." at 2 in the morning and then make it happen. Or be cravin McDonalds Apple Juice. **I thank you guys for that, SO MUCH by the way**  I hope you guys had a safe trip home..not smoking weed, talking on the cell phone, and taking turns holding the steering wheel.  I loved swimming in thee ocean. It was really warm. I really  wanted the boys to come swim with us. But they would not swim. Sad, sad stuff. I hope those boys care as much as they seemed to, and I really hope they come back..er..yeah.   The Hornby Trip was grreat. I had so much fun. And there were no boys or alchohol involved. Proud? That's what I thought.  Stephy and I ruined our "Liquor-priviledge" on the first day because the parents did not make it clear how much of the drink we were allowed to sample. Silly parents. While at hornby..we..ate a lot of popsicles, drank a lot of 'bottled beverages' and washed our faces A LOT. We got really tanned. I love being tanned.  Curtis is dissapointed in me because I'm stupid. That makes my heart cry. It also makes my heart feel really..really sorry.

So that when I'm not really talking, and I'm sitting there, and saying "K" and "haha" and "Mhm.." It's not because I'm a bitch, and it's not because I'm busy. It's because I'm sitting there, and thinking wow, and I so badly want to say ( in some cases type) more, and have a conversation with you but it's like I don't have the energy. I don't see the point. If I have a big conversation with you it's not going to change the fact that all I can think about is how bad I want to be..Yup. It has a lot to do with the fact that I'm EXTREMELY stuborn as well so when I start being a bitch and ignoring you and you say i'm being a bitch and ignoring you and I deny it, I cant go back and say sorry, cuz I'm a bitch.... Anyways. Yes. So I'd like to appologize to all of you who've called me/talked to me on msn and I've been a stupid annoying stinker. :) That is all. I've now completely vented and I'm readddy to talk fully to you in full..converstaion mode.

      I'm sort of done breaking down. Now I'm just crying. Crying because of reasons. Do you ever have one of those nights where all you want is to sleep on the floor? This is my floor sleeping night. I've decided maybe I should stop telling everyone else they've changed and focus on the fact that I've changed...But maybe I haven't..maybe i'm just..I don't know. I'm so sorry to all of you, especially Shayne, for being so stupid and so immature and so hypocritical. I've become everything that I hate and I've treated you all like you're less than I am...I hate this whole week, and this whole day, and this whole hour and minute and second and everything I am now. I miss Ryan more than anyone could ever EVER imagine and I need him to come back now... I also miss Cody. Maybe I just miss having someone to talk to that doesn't fuck me over and we can have a long 6 hour phone conversation without being assholes to eachother. Ugh. I'm done.

One of those days where I'm completely done and then I piss someone off, and then I feel so bad for pissing him..er..that person off that I completely break down because I'm too stupid and stuborn to say sorry even though I know I'm wrong and then it ends up ruining our friendship. Or lack of. Anyways. Yes. Completely done. Everything is falling down, once again. But I'm sure I'll be okay tomorrow. Yes...tomorrow. Although...the quote   "Smile, tomorrow will be worse."   is probably going to come true.   Anyways yeah...I'm stupid..and i'm a bitch. And it appears i have begun to care about someone who I shouldn't. Becuase you know, there's definitly rules. Whatever. That's all. I only wrote this becuase I said I would write every day.

I hate the way you drive my car,     I hate it when you stare.     I hate your big dumb combat boots and the way you read my mind.     I hate you so much it makes me sick,it even makes me rhyme.     I hate the way you’re always right, I hate it when you lie.     I hate it when you make me laugh,     even worse when you make me cry.      I hate it when you’re not around,     and the fact that you didn’t call.     But mostly I hate the way I don’t hate you,     not even close…not even a little bit…not even at all.

When you ask to see my boobs, and I respond with 'no', that is your cue to piss off and stop asking.   Curtis, I'm sorry, but that's a very VERY 'soft spot' and you need to stop..please. If you find humor in it, find humor in it outside of the time you're talking to me, please. I 'love you as a friend' buddy. Please stop being angered. I'm sorry for saying a bad word to you. I take back the evil.  I'm    so sorry   . Anyways. Yes. Curtis is my new 'boyfriend' ;) He makes my heart skip a beat. Ohhh yes...hahaha    "It's down to this, I've got to make this life make sense. I missed the life, I miss the colors of the world. Now again I found myself, so far down, away from the sun that shines. Into the darkest place, I'm so far down, away from the sun again."     Tonight...I'm hanging out with Brandon and Stephy.  We were  going  to go to the movies. I have no money, however, so we're going to do something free. Something free like....Standing on the side of the road..watching cars go by. Or maybe.. walking aimlesly around town. Or maybe even eating grass? Realistically though, we're probably just going to go to Stephy's house and watch movies.  Onto another note. I'm very proud of Stephy and I.  We're doing very good with the whole 'friendship' thing.  Everything is slowly, ( very very slowly ), coming back together. Everything is falling into place and I can't help but be happy!  I had to wake up at 8 today..and then I went for a walk after my mom left for work and I was back at home by 8:30. At 8:30 I went back to sleep and I ended up sleeping until 2:00. I feel so ...'yick' I'm happy Stephy called me because I would have slept forever.    That is all for now my friends;

Etymology: French, literally, sabbath, from Latin sabbatum: a midnight assembly of diabolists (as witches and sorcerers) held especially in medieval and Renaissance times to renew allegiance to the devil through mystic rites and orgies.

       I am too tired to write..but I decided I would write every day..but I probably won't after the first week..but it's only the second day..Oh I am rambling...Oh well, bare with me. Today was extremely eventful and yet extremely...I don't know. We went to the parade. It was 2000 degrees and I thought I was going to die. My mom left us there becuase she couldn't find us at the park and got sick of looking..so Stephy and I had to wait outside my cousins car on the side of the road for numerous hours to see if she eventually got around to coming back to her car to give us a ride. Then we went to my Grandparents...We fell asleep for like an hour. Damnit. We broke the beautiful cycle of no sleep. It's o kay though, I don't blame myself. Anyone would have slept at the Grandparents house. It's just so damn comfy. Tonight..we went to the fireworks. It was interesting but wet and tooo many people. Being around large groups of people is not my friend. The Gramma promised me waffles for breakfast. Does she know how long I've been craving waffles? :D Ohh...waffles. I must go to bed now so the waffles will come sooner. LoL   *~Night-Night to Myself~*

      Last night..was..in one word...' Interesting.' First off, the beautiful sex talk with the beautiful parents of us. Parents who have, since the sex talk, decided to let us hornby it up by ourselves. Secondly, we got over the hump. Celebrate it. Stephanie peed her pants and threw up several times, while I puked in the beautiful blue ikea garbage can. We had a fight, actually..we had numerous fights. None of which are remembered by me now. We talked to Caleb all night..made plans for our photo shoot. Took some of our own photos. Hence the title. Elegantly...naked..photos... Masterpieces. Stayed up all night. Babysat...although..were too..'intoxicated' to watch the kid, heard it yell though..stuck a bottle in her mouth. I love that baby:) Finished with the night time..ate breakfast (china food) Also..talked to Curtis last night for a good and long time. Fantastically interesting stuff. Danced for people on webcam. Extremely exciting. Can't breathe. Forgot to take my pill again. Can't swallow..but maybe that's just our 'dry mouth' syndrome. Day..interesting...Night..more so. Going to the parade in a few hours. Should be interesting. Going to the fireworks tonight, should be..firey. That is all. Good day to all of you people who are bored enough to read this profile, I feel bad for you, truly truly sorry and truly truly disgraced.
