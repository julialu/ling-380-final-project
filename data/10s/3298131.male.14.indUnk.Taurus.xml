      I'm building a lounge downstairs so we can have parties and crap that are a whole lot cooler. If all goes well, I'll have a recording studio setup down there, and of course a skating area.

      yeah, i figured since i listen to it so much, i might as well start playin it. anyway, i've got the lead guitar covered but i still need someone to play bass, a drummer, maybe a backup guitar, and someone to do vocals. you gotta live in or around gallatin, tn (town in the middle of nowhere that you've probably never heard of) and be 13-17. anyone got any suggestions for a name?
