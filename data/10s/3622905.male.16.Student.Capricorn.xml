       its been long.. VERY LONG.. since i even decided to post sumthing of inherent interest to the minority group of people out there who actually bother to read this insignificant blog of mine.. (thx btw.. ^^) anywae.. i juz decided 2 blog all of a sudden cos of the pointless behaviour that i have been exhibiting these daes.. i juz feel that im not realli me animore.. i mean.. im still pretty much myself.. making corny jokes.. trying 2 cheer pple up and that sorta stuff.. overreacting pretty badly at times.. and the other stuff that i dare not mention that which whole in whole make up me..

       juz this saturday.. i was grimly reminded by my psyche that i was afraid of dogs.. why? cos when i was walking back home from church.. i came across this owner walking this german sheperdish looking dog.. pretty fierce looking according to me.. though it seemed uninterested in me.. i tried my best to pull a calm mask over my face while trying my best to avoid the beast as well as i could..
