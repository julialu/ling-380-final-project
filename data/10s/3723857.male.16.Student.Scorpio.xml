      Just finished my maths paper today.. out of 12 questions I didn't do 4.. two questions cost me 14 marks and the other two cost me 10 marks..Tomorrow is physics, how am going to overcome this one? This time I'm really in hot soup..  Haha if you've known a girl for 2 months is it a bit too quick to ask her out? My bro said yes.. and I'm starting to think that its true too..but no choice cos she's really too nice.. how many girls now are that nice? Its not just a pretty face that matters you know..but now I don't think she'll like me already ~

      today a friend just turned me down and he didn't want to go out with me tomorrow.. so sad.. he already promised me 1 week ago and now he just backs out like that. Anyway, I don't think anyone would know that this blog exists.. so I might as well just write my inner thoughts and feelings here.. if you chance upon this then you're lucky :)  There's four more days left to my mid-year examinations and I haven't started studying yet.. I don't think I'll do well for this exams.. And I didn't know that a birthday present could be so hard to find.. Two birthdays are coming right up and I already spent like a quarter of the holidays trying to find a nice one..

      Firstly, today was quite a short day.. not like the other days.. I slacked the whole day in sch.. but still learnt quite a lot from the physics enrichment lecture.. actually I already knew it lolz..tonite still must do econs homework.. pengz..   Wow today during P.E.. she was avoiding me.. supposed to be in the same team as me.. yet she chose to change team..

      Today we were supposed to hand in the Group Project File.. but as usual.. still can't finish it.. nvm we're near there.. just work a bit harder.. and today's differentiation wasn't that bad.. studied it before..but vectors won't be that easy.. remember relative velocity? lolz..  Haiz..I think she already likes someone else.. not that sure about it.. but quite certain.. see her actions lor.. can tell.. my gf was also like that last time..maybe take one step at a time and see how it goes..Hope that one day she can give me a chance..I'll surely take very good care of her :)  Quote of the day:  Love without return is just like a question without an answer.

      Haha today was quite a busy day..with pw , econs and gp.. so many things to do.. and so little time to do it.. tmr gotta pass up the pw file.. so many things haven't finished..and the other groups are far ahead of us..really scared now..  And she dao me again..I'm  really really sorry ..hope that she can forgive me..I think I really irritated her..should let her cool down first.. But the thing is..I really love her..and I love her for who she is..not what she is.. Although my gf is much prettier , smarter , funnier , blah blah.. but she's really different from my gf.. I just can't explain it..she's a really nice girl..She's definitely my SoulMate.. I'll wait for her..even if she doesn't want me.. I'll still wait..  Quote of the day:  Life is the flower for which love is the honey. =)

      Today I just got back my maths paper..just barely passed and my econs mcq was 23 out of 30.. quite ok already considering that I didn't study at all and spent the last few weeks in sorrow.. Haha really dun wanna take back physics.. half the paper was blank.. sure'll look good..   Anyway, today's still one of the best days this year.. hehe you should know why.. but somebody is daoing me.. I still have feelings for her..and it will always stay.. but I just wanna be her fren.. but why she still dao me.. I dun like ppl to dao me.. the feeling of being ignored is absolutely tormenting.. Or maybe she's just avoiding me.. I think I made her angry and pissed her off..I'm really sorry but I dun think she knows it.. Haiz can see that she likes another person liaoz.. and I'm back with my gf.. well life is like that..   Quote of the day: The best thing in the world is when two people love each other and hold true to that love.

(Means I've gotta study hard?)
