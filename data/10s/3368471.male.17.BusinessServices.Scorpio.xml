      Lets take back all the hatred  lets clean the slate lets remember back when these kids were still gay..           I'm just Wondering if anyone really knows me? I'm going to die alone just how I came in. My reasons why are simple I have no Emotion the only ones I have are Hatred and sadness. Now people are going to think I'm some kind of depressed kid or something, negative. My Hatred fuels me to go on and piss off other people. Hatred and sadness isn't something I gained threw being a teenager its from years upon years of racism, no trust, and Crazy parents. The only times I'm happy is when I'm talking to my girlfriend but she lives 50 miles away. God is laughing it up, up there.  jehova's witness came over today, I found out a couple things. we are god's Slaves, as it says in the bible Jesus Christ will resurrect us from the dead. To do what you may ask? To work for god and "make the world the paradise, the way it was suppose to be". I don't know about you but that seems like slavery to me, what the fuck is wrong with the world anyways abously god hasn't been to Puerto Rico that's a fucking paradise. I seriously cant believe people think this bullshit is going to happen and actually want it to happen. Fuck this I'm going to start ::sinning::. Get this I'm working from ages 16-iono maybe 76 and then I have to work again after I die WTF!!

      And this wonderful girl that I fell in love with is loving, caring, funny, smart, and beautiful. She is better than me in everyway, I would do anything for her, her special kiss, her lovely smile, her gorgeous eyes. everytime I think of her she makes me smile and get butterflies in my stomach she is awesome. I would give her the star themselves if I could. I wouldn't want to loose something so precious to me...

      Well... have any of you got death threats before? so he grabs by the collar while on changing downstairs, and starts talking about something I told someone the day before, which at the time I didn't know was such a big deal he somehow finds out the next day and asks me why I said that I didn't know what the hell he was talking about I thought it was one of usual gay jokes. So he tells me you said this to that girl and I'm oh yea I did, and he is like why? I'm like what kind of question is that its small talk I didn't know that I wasn't suppose to say they were going out. Anyways he is like tell her your were joking around whatever whatever... And then he says in the scariest voice ever..." I don't want any problems". I ignore it, he walks away and I continue changing he comes back like 2 minutes later saying remember what I said! I don't want no problems I don't want no problems  I'll kill you Carlos  I was like WTF!! So the whole day I'm scared as fuck all my employees asking me why I look so sad. Fucking crackhead I call him Crazy eyes so fuck McDonald's I quit this is my 2 weeks notice...  and then they ask why I'm so paranoid

      Hmmm Love is the weirdest thing ever. Yesterday I woke up not wanting her back, but today I woke up with tears&nbsp;on my face and that queasy feeling in my stomach. I dreamed about her today its was really weird, I love her so much this is so weird hmmm. well now all I said yesterday have turned into lies, so I'm a liar now w00t. THIS SUCKS AHHHHH. I fell asleep expecting to play games and watch TV on my day off and now I want to go see her but she's grounded...Love prefails over all. The letter I sent to her mom,&nbsp;I'm happy now for sending its really really weird hmm maybe her mom will call and tell me to come over iono, hope... In the dream I was talking to her maybe I'm back in love because of that iono. Now I remember what I wanted to say before.   &nbsp;   she      Her voice takes my pain away  Her hugs brings me to another world  Her kiss brings me to heaven  I could never ask for more...      &nbsp;  Grr  I love you  Stefanie    I’m sick of always hearing  All the sad songs on the radio  All day it is there to remind  An oversensitive guy  That he’s lost and alone  Yeah  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Blink182

      Wow Today was the first day in about 3 weeks that I didn't wake up with tears running down my face, I woke up with a kitten messing with me to play with it. So I woke up not loving Stefanie as much as I did last week which is a good thing, I realize now that she would never do the things I did for her and that she really wasn't in love with me well at one point she had a deep crush... I know this because she would still be with me if she loves me, I don't hate her I'm just realizing what everyone has been telling me for the past 3 weeks that " if she truly loves you she would be with you now ". I quit trying to make her fall in love with me because I know now that you cant change people. I love her so much and I just want the best for her she doesn't care about me because I know now she is thinking about her grounded boyfriend and not me. I don't want to live life without regrets and I'm not going to because I know I tried with all I had to get her back with me, she just doesn't love me. She says she is confused but if she "confused" why is she with him and not with no one? 4 months of complete love she cheated on me twice which yet again proofs she didn't love me that she only thinks about herself, I was just too blind to see it, since when your in love your really really blind. Love is great I don't hate it and I hope I will fall in love with someone else again because those 4 months were the happiest of my life. They say you don't know true happiness till you have been in love and that you have never been in true pain till you have lost it. I know for a fact that if she truly loved me like she&nbsp;said she did&nbsp;she is going to realize what she has lost, because I know that&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm better&nbsp;for&nbsp;her in every&nbsp;way as a person and as a friend. She truly took me for granted and I know she will be thinking about me when she is 23&nbsp;LOL&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   &nbsp;  Today I woke up with a smile on my face. I know that she might still have a part of my heart but she doesn't have all of it, so I will love again and I will be looking at the stars for another angel to fall down. I might not love that person as much as I loved Stefanie but there are going to have to except that if they love me. I might not   walk   50 mile for them but I might ride a bike 100 miles what I'm saying is that I'll take love a little bit slower next time and I'll savor the love a little better, I'm not going to just rush into things like I did last time. So I'm smiling, why? Because I know I'm still standing even though she completely broke my heart, I'm still here despite how much pain I've been through. I've always said that everyone is here for a&nbsp;purpose for how ever big or small that purpose is. I always try to shine the light in the Darkness sort of speak. I'm already starting to like someone which is a good thing,&nbsp;I'm going to&nbsp;try to ask her out on a date as friend, I'm way to shy to do that LOL but I'll try doesn't ever hurt to try, right? Live life to love and love life to live on and become stronger from your mistakes and wounds. Life is a mystery with endless roads and trails. I'm just going to become stronger from all these experiences. I thank Vero for trying to tell me this but at the time I was in love and I couldn't see 2 feet in front of me. I'm not going to regret not having Stef because I didn't loose her she lost me. I'm so happy and it feels good that she lost and not I, and they say nice guys finish last... HA!   I just wanted to say..  Thank you for everyone who helped me through this. You all are great friends  Sorry I didn't mention my most important friend Alexa she was my shoulder to cry on. I love you  Thank You    Love prevails over all...

      I talk to you every now and then  I never felt so alone again  I stop to think at a wishing well  My thoughts send me on a carousel  Here I am standing on my own  Not a motion from the telephone  I know not a reason why  Solitudes a reason to die  Just you wait and see  As school life is a  It is a woken dream  Aren't you feeling alone?  I guess its just another  I guess its just another  I guess its just another night alone  Now as I walk down the street  I need a job just to sleep in sheets  Buying food every once in a while  But not enough to purchase a smile  A tank of gas is a treasure to me  I know now that nothing is free  I talk to you every now and then  I never felt so alone again  Just you wait and see  As school life is a  It is a woken dream  Aren't you feeling alone?  I guess its just another  I guess its just another  I guess its just another night alone  &nbsp; I love you Stefanie

There were bikes doing wheelies on the highway and one of them passed us Pablo got pissed and raced him. He fucking roasted him, trust me when your going 120+mph nothing seems to matter anymore since all your thinking is your about to die at any moment it reminded me of the old times when I used to skate...

      So I love her, I love her so much that's its making me blind  I was talking to my friend yesterday and she is like if she's is telling you she wants to be with you and loves you why isn't she with you now?&nbsp;  &nbsp;  It took me a while to register that because I don't want to believe that I'm really going to be alone I don't want to believe that she is not coming back and I'm not going to believe, I love her and even though everyone is telling me to forget her and move on, something inside me tells me she is coming back to me. I know I'm crazy and I know I should just move on but I really do think we're meant to be w/e. Right now I really don't care what people think about me and her I just want to be with her. They told me she's not coming back I don't want to believe this, I don't. I love you Stefanie why am I the only person who understands you? ::sigh:: that quote has been running through my mind all night and day " if she is telling you she wants to be with you and loves you  why isn't she with you now ? ".  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Love is so blind its not even funny, its right there in front of me and I can't even see it  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  "don't ever love anything kiddo, because you'll just end up loosing it"  - Lost in Space   Stefanie&nbsp; I love you  like no other

        so she was 14 when I... She's been dating him for HOW LONG?!??!?!!?  Love: A deep, tender, ineffable feeling of affection and solicitude toward a person, such as that arising from kinship, recognition of attractive qualities, or a sense of underlying oneness.   For whatever I say I want you to know I love you and I want to stay with you  This was writing when I was sad and angry, please don't take any offense  I LOVE YOU  the prettiest people do the ugliest things   Today is Saturday the 10th of July....  We are breaking up, I don't know why. I'm here waiting.. waiting for something to happen, waiting for someone to love, you told me last night you were going to call me from the looks of it it doesn't seem like you are going to call, but I'll be here waiting, waiting for that phone to ring, waiting for that "I love you" to come.  So I'm here, thinking about you like INSANELY CRAZY, I'm crying... ::sigh:: there is nothing I can do now, there's is nothing I can say. I know now that I wasn't meant to love someone, I'm not meant to be loved by someone, I wasn't meant to be with someone.... God hates me.  I'm reading your letters, you were so much in love with me... All of the things you said have now turned into lies. Stef I love you please please don't let this go, don't let me go, I gave you my heart "no take backs" for as long as I live you will always have it. It hurts, the thought of you, with another person while holding my heart, it hurts loosing you, it it... Feels like death.  There is two sides of me, my logical side which believes Teen dating is overrated and completely pointless because there is no way you can keep Two kids in love with each forever, he is more pesstimistic. My other side is hard to explain his the one you know the best the one that wants to be with you forever the one that doesn't listen to the logically thing, the one that sees light at the end of the tunnel.  I don't think I can move on... I'm going to do the illogical thing and pour my heart out to you, but first I'm going to show you how you poured your heart out to me.....        1st letter...  Dear Carlos~  What's up? Nothing much here. I thought I would send you this picture even though it doesn't look like me anymore. Right now you are working and I just finished working out, I love you so much. I really want to meet you as soon as possible, it is driving me crazy. I am nervous about it though. I don't want to lose you ever, you already mean so much to me, I don't know what I would do if I were to lose you so soon. This picture is from October at a friend's b-day party. I hope I see you soon and I love you honey!   Con Amor,  Stefanie     2nd letter...  Carlos  Hey Honey-  What's up? I'm so so bored so I decided to write you a letter. You are at work right now and I'm sitting outside, my dad came him tonight and he is working outside. Four more days and I will hopefully be seeing you, but by the time you get this it will be less than that. I was talking about it with Abigail today and we got really nervous. I hope everything works out between us. It is a huge mess with me, you, and Alexa. I don't Hanna lose you and I don't wanna give you up. I just want to be able to trust you and I want you to trust me. IT IS SO HOT!! OMG! I want to go inside, but then I will have nothing to do. I haven't decided what I am going to do when I first see you, I guess I will see what happens. I hope you will like me with my different hair and all. This was a really random letter, but I felt like writing you. U R SO AWESOME!! (even more than me)  (I know that you know, I just wanted to tell you again) -------------------------------------

      i really do think life wants me to kill myself. everything i ever believed is becoming false, everyone who i know is going crazy, work sucks dick. My ex-girlfriend fucking hates me she doesnt even wanna see my face or hear my voice, God i love her, this is the worse month of my entire life, im waiting for someone to kill me. No one cares it seems no hears me screaming no one hears me crying. It doesnt stop hurting no one sees me hurting they're all selfish i need to escape i which i had her i love her so much, everything is wrong nothing is right, everything is wrong nothing is right.   FUCK IT
