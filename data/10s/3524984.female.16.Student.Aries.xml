      It sickens me to know that I am afraid of food. I can be so shallow. Lets see. Yesterday...I woke up at around noon...had a glass of water...then at around three...I had a glass of grape juice...at five...everyone was having supper so, I joined in like a huge pig...and had a salad...ugh! I went to bed at around 1:00AM. One of my aunts who is close to my "new" family came over for supper..so I really had to force myself to eat...though, the feeling of food being stuffed in your mouth, isn't really a desired one...well anyway..about that aunt of mine...can anybody say -huge-son-of-a-bitch- 10 times real fast?! She was talking to my erm "dad" since my "mum" is nowhere to be found...[though she did call me and tell me that everything was alright, and that - no she wasn't coming back...ok. I'm heart broken...and it sucks to know that you miss your own replacement mom...I'm not supossed to hate her?! Oh well...she was there for me and I am thankful for everything she and "dad" have done.] UGH! I keep going back to another subject... *coughs*becauseIdontWantToTalkAboutIT*coughs* Anyway, she was like "Tim, dear. You have to watch that freak show, you know shes going to be 6 feet under if you dont watch her...Just like that mother of hers! She calls herself a mother, she was clearly knocked up with her first child, what was it again..Michael his name was...where is he anyway Tim?! Dont tell me you dont know!" I was in such a rage, that I got up from the table, jai toute sacré on the floor and I was just fed up of her and her antics...she cant go spread bullshit somewhere else but here!? The wacko...shes such a dumbass!! Dont ask, just dont...*cries* WTF am I doing... Ugh, I called nat today...only too find out she was gone to Montreal for the week. too bad, I'm not headed there for about another couple of days. By the time I get there, she'll be back here...meh. whatever...I need someone too talk to...and, well...apart from Dee or Billy...All I have friends I've met online...But - I would only talk to one of them...and thats only if THEY started the convo...I dont want to have some kind of pity party going on..It's just the guy, he understands so much...I dont know...I just, like him alot..My dad wont stop it with the phone calls..he always says the same thing "I never meant to hit you Em. You know you're an amazing person...blah blah blah..."then the moment came..he said IT..."im sorry"...this was the perfect moment to show him how much I really didn't care and that he had lost me forever...I just said..."If only sorry could heal all the scars...If only you hadn't hit me all those times...If only..." and I hung up...and I cried for awhile...I just wanted a normal family..for once..just for once..try to see what its like...I called BELL© Telephone a little later and blocked his cell phone number...his home phone..everything... SHAY- RIP JENN &amp; DAVID...J'vous Aiment!

       I haven't updated lately...but...meh, things happen. Ok, so some poeple want some GRAD 2004 reviews!    Grad Day  Jess, Nat, Lucie and I all went to Jess's to go swim. Of course...I had to get all "body-consious" and not go...but whatever™...After that, Jess and Lucie went to get their hair done. fun fun. Meh...I didn't get mine done...I did it myself. :D During that time. Me and Nat walked the streets and just were plain bored. Thats us though. At around 3:00 PM we went and got Nat's hair done. Her hair was nice. Great actually. But, I just went home,and was like fuck all. Der...I'm always like that...   Grad Night  Ok, supper was horrible. But I didn't mind. I had a glass of juice and some bread sticks. Ok, yes..my eating problems must stop and I know it...

      FUCK YOU, YOU, AND YES...YOU! ALL OF YOU!  You know, people at school are mean...Idiots. You can't even wear what you want. I got this wicked roxy™ tee shirt...and I cant wear it, because the mf-ing bitchy preps will kill me. Either that or eat me alive. Ouch.  My dad is corny. I come in from school and ask him, as always "Hey, has mom came back home? or, did she call?" He always just smiles, and says no. Whatthefuck?!  Where is she? Why did she leave? Just like anything I ever had that was good. it either dies, or leaves.  cries  Why?! I just want an answer..she doesn't HAVE to come back if she doesn't care..right?  Definetly Right. Just...I dont feel like doing this long update...I'm to busy eating everything I can find! RIP Jenn and David! - Shay

       *cries*  Why? What is fake is falling apart. Help! Look, I know I dont live a fairytale life. But...why? Why do I always have to go and make up this fantasies for myself. Act as if everything is alright, when obviously it isn't. Ok, just to get all my fantasy readers into my real world here is how the story goes...  My mom, is dead. Nothing much to say here. Thats it. My dad, wants nothing to do with me because I'm a girl. So what?!. Meh, I live with the people I call "Mum & Pop". They never tell me anything. at all. I know they dont love each other like they used to but, please when something goes wrong...just tell me. I hate finding things out on my own. Its just wrong. Yeh. Wrong. Bah, Fuck it  I mean, nothing in my life has ever been remarkably "fun". I'm the one everyone hates to love. I'm sweet, caring...blah blah blah. Ok maybe not. I am anti social, a bitch to some extent, nosey, stuck-up and hot headed. If I was to go on...There would be no more room left...lol... I always get the pity...when someone finds out what happend...I'll try to lie..so that they treat me the same...but they  ALWAYS  find out!! WHY!? Bah. Fuck it.  But now...things with Mum and Pop aren't going so well...Its like I dont exist. They never tell me anything they always make it seem as if I am too much trouble for them. FUCK IT..!!  Well they tore it apart my  "family"  Are a bunch of nitwits and all hate each other. I came back from something with a special friend of mine, to find that  mum  wasn't home. I asked  pop  where she was...and he said she had left...To wherE? he will not tell me...Oh Goddammit! She still isn't back...and I came back last night!  *cries*   You see...everything is gone. All my illusions they are actually FAKE!   I wish I could talk to someone...but Meggiez and Mookie are up stairs and I dont want to bother them...{NO...THEY AREN'T DOING  THAT !!} Even someone online would be great..I talked to Joel...but that dont help me any...I dont know why I dont talk to Tae anymore...I guess its because he is annoyed with me...for not posting in Scrrap...Meh.   I cant talk to Billy..hes moving all day today. Joey was here...but its no use...I want to talk to Billy...Alot. Lets go see if his mobile is on...RIP Jenn~ SEM

      Oh Gawd. What has happened to innocent Sem?!She left...shes gone! Ok, so...Rick. Problem number one! Why Rick? He is so, nice...but he seems to forget that I have my own life. I can't always be "there". Right?  He has called me over six times. Always asking me if I can go out with him. I always say no. BEcause, I am not "into" him that way. I've told him SO many times...but he keeps going at me...:( He is now mad at Billy, he says its all Billys fault that I am not "into" him that way! Huh? He doesn't know apparently...Eep.   Went to the brige today. Seen where those two people were killed. So sad. There are flowers everywhere around the water...poor dude will be missed, Big Time. He died with his mom. Poor soul. How hard can it get?  I'm really tired. Tired of school mostly. Exams and all.

      No No No No! This cant be happening! No! There is only 6 days of school left. I usually dont care, like before there was always next year to talk to my friends...but now, there is no more "next year" And there is no more friends to talk to. I'm moving, so I am automatically changing schools. Dammit. Billy is moving to, but only two streets down. Meh. Lucy ass, gets his old friends back, he gets Joey, and the same town. Here I am, no Billy, no friends, no same town. Bah, I should just fuck it I guess...But I want a good chance,more like a fair chance a being sucessful at life and school...stuff like that.  I guess I'll have to get throught next year alone.  I will survive. I mean, new school chance of change..right? I dont want to change..but whatever™ Hopefully they aren't a bunch of stuck up losers who they think they know it all...:P My choice of french to english is a bit drastic. I know. But hey, a highschool is a highschool is a highschool. *duh* Just a diffrent shit load of preps, right? :P Oh no, major factor: Preps. Yikes. They scare me. Uh-huh, yes they do :'( Maybe they'll belong to a nice society of preps. *Meh, dream on loser*  I dont know. The fact that I'll probably only be spending two years there makes me feel ALOT better. I wont be a prisonner in my own school. Just turned 16 in grade 11. Is that normal. I think so. I'm supossed to be in 12th because I was offered to take summer classes to get over 79 in math so I could boost up, but nah. Enough that I'm going to be new there, I dont want them to think I'm a french brainball...yucky.  I'm leaning towards their sports team. Basketball? Oh, hiya...it's my passion. ;) I hear at my new school they have "LAW" courses. Yayness. Oh, hiya...it's Law, my other passion. When Basketball and Law meet. ;)  *It's weird, Jenn wouldhave loved it..RIP Jenn :'(*  You know. I'm in love with this blogging thing. Like totally. No one reads it...but just to write and spread my thoughts. It feels awesome.   Oh, I joined a contest today at http://www.peta2.com "I am not a nugget" Yeh, you guessed it , I'm a vegatarien. :P I'm getting some stickers...YAY! :) So fun, so fun.  I just cut my hair, by myself...free hand. About 3 inches off the back.

      Ugh. The heat is unbearable! I'm dying here man! The fact that I am wearing jeans, tee shirt and a sweat shirt is getting to me now. o.O  Grad is soon. :( I dont want to leave at the end of this year! No! I can't. Billy is moving this year too! :( Aww well, I'm moving he's moving. We have e-mail, and then the phone. I'll be missing him SO much. Hopefully he will get things straightened out with Joey. Nah, I they will. For sure. *whispers* They're perfect for each other!  *dies* The Heeeeeat! Ack. Ooh, I'm multi-tasking! I'm talking to Billy on the phone, writing this, chatting with various people, sending out invites to the grad party...  I have so many projects for tomorrow..*dies* Someone help me finish all this BULLSHIT!

      Billy wants to appear on my blog {bless his soul}. I told him that he already has. Then, he said he wanted to have something happy. So, Billy here we go :P  ..::Billy, I love ya! So so much! I hope that I will see ya more often since I am changing school's this year! You said we'd be friends forever! Keep that promise, I can't live without you. (I dont think anyone could.:D)::..  Anyway. *shrugs* Today, I had P.E. Dammit. We ran 600meters, then went on to the Long jumping. < ~S-em

      One word; NO.  Last night one of my cousins got married Jackie. Well, for me, this was to be another boring wedding reception, were you know all you're going to do is sit and whine.   Well, it was until Carole asked me if I wanted a drink. Erm, like a REAL drink? She was like whatever™ you want dear. I said, well, how about some Vodka. Without even telling my mom. She went up and got me one. I felt pretty cool. Standing there, with a drink in my hands. Oh yeah! Until the bartender came and asked me if I had some ID on me. I knew I wasn't of age to drink so, I said it was my friends. I was just holding it while she was dancing. He smiled at me and then left. Right at that moment, I knew I couldn't have anymore to drink, or else. But, on a normal trip to the washrooms. I ran into Jennifer, Tina and Amy. All my cousins, all up for a great time. They seen my drink, and they were like "Do you smoke?" That I simply refused to do. Nope. No. That's not me. The drinking was. At the end of the night, I had had a round of Tequilla shooters, 4 Smirnoff's, and a beer. I had never drank before. And, now. I have. I will be going to the next weddings for that side of my family. That was way past awesome! Now, I have a HUGE headache, I can't concentrate, and I'm all shaky...Ew. It was worth it though! Oh Yeah! I think I only did it because I was depressed. I kept the Smirnoff's coming, the tequilla was just another thing. More like a dare. Ouch. I miss Jenn. If she was here, I probably wouldn't have went to the stupid wedding. I would have went to her house to hang out and have some fun joking around. Either that or talked to Billy all night long!   Icky. Billy is also going through some hards times now-a-days. I think he misses Joey. His Ex. Joey and Billy were perfect for each other! I loved double dating with Shane. I was sure Joey had a thing for Shane even if Shane was straight, and Joey was gay. Bah, it's all the same. Billy needs to rest. I think he has always been there for me. I spent the night over at his house almost all week. I didn't go to school. Neither did he. We skipped together. It was great. Until we went in to the corner store to get some slushes and we say him. Joey. There, with a girl in a total make-out session. Now, I was friends with Joey. And he never told me he was Bisexual. What!?   Billy ran out of the store. I stayed there and watched Joey and his "gal" make out for awhile he finally got up, and said to me "Em, what in God's name are you doing?!" I looked at him and told him to check his in-voice, then check his sexuality...before going and using MY best friend - ever again! He just looked at me, and you could see he was embaressed. Well, why!? He seen out the window. There was Billy sitting down on the sidewalk. Probably counting the grains of sand. *sighs* Aww...Billy! Joey grabbed my arm, I pulled away and left to go outside. Fuck the slushes! Billy and I walked all the way home silently. Thing was...we were headed for my place. I wasn't going to stop and say everything I had planned. So I went to my house. When I got there, my parents were gone as for Tom and Mookie. Well, we're alone. Lucky us. Right then I realized my answering machine in my room has over 20 messages. 28 to be exact. Some from Joey, some from Jules, others from Mookie. Oh well, lets "delete" them all so it looks like I care. Deep breath now. Ok. Done.   Billy threw himself on my un-made bed. And just started to cry. Oh, Billy crying. Not a good thing. I looked at him and started crying too. So there we were, crying on a Wensday afternoon, in my bed together. We stayed that way until the phone rang, and I knew it was going to be Joey. It was. He was just talking and ranting and raving about how much he was sorry. I said not a word and hung up. That was the last time I talked to him. And I hope Billy and him get back together after he gets everything right in his life.   ..::Billy! I know you're reading this...and I just want you to know...I love you! And I'll always be there::.. ~S-em

      Having a bad day. Or a bad week. Maybe even a bad month. I can't stand this anymore. I can't. I promised Billy I would stop the cutting once and for all. But, I can't cope with Jenn's death alone. I've been with her sister Julie for the last couple of days. Just sitting there and crying. She's 16, and had one sister and that sister is dead. I hate this. Why? Oh Why?! I wish I could know what she's feeling. I am feeling really really bad. Can I imagine her, all alone. For the rest of time. I Love You Jenn! We All Do! R.I.P  My computer breaks down in the middle of the week. I'm totally fucked then. I fixed it myself. I'm really good with computers. Well, I would like to think so. I used to suck at it. But computers were involved in my life at the age of 5! Ok, 11 years later, I'm a computer wiz. Yuck. I won't be fixing anyone's computer for awhile. I haven't left the house for over a week. I only left to go to the Funeral Home, The Funeral and when she was burried. This is too hard for me. I thought I would never say that. *sobs*  When I saw Jenn's boyfriend, the first thing he says to me was "I suppose this is the lowest of the low?" I just stood there, and nodded my head. Afraid that if I would cry, I wouldn't be able to control myself. Julie on the other hand was letting it all hang out. I think that they almost had to get her out of the Funeral Home once or twice. Jenn is already missed. More than I had imagined before. That morning I remember when my English teacher told me. I froze. And asked him if I could go home. He nodded, and said "Well, what do you want me to say Em?" I just burst out in tears. He just let me walk out like that. But I didn't go home. I walked around town until school was actually out. I walked for almost 5 hours. I didn't know where I was going until I passed by Jenn's house knocked at her door. Julie answered. And I just gave her the biggest hug. We stayed in the doorway at least 15minutes. We All Love You Julie!   I can't believe it. It was ALL OVER the fucking news! What!? They called Jenn a "Long-Time Drug Addict" What?! No No No! That's bullshit. Simply. I mean, how could they do that to her? Her family was so pissed off. {Julie, was the most.} At school, this girl said "She died! So what? She was good-for-nothinG! She'll rot in Hell" One of Jenn's cousins came up to the girl, slapped her, kicked her, and was screaming like nuts. I am proud of her! Way-to-Go! That girl deserves to die! (I sound like her! Icky!) Ok, no death wishes!  I wish I could write more...But I can't I am shaking like nuts. It's taking me hours to write this. And no one is reading. Oh, I should go continue my Novel. "Tales of the Disturbed" I have over twenty pages full. I think I might post some up here. But I'm not sure. It's bad. And all these ideas of death my ruin it all! ~S-em

      Today, let's describe THAT.  Today is the tommorow you worried about yesterday...*thinks* How stupid is THAT?!  I worry about everything and anything...I hate suprises, I hate the way the sun rises in the morning, I hate it when everyone seems happier than me, I hate it when people assume just because I wear black means I am goth, I hate the way people ask you how you are when they know you feel horrible most of the time, I hate YOU! I'm no people person, whatchya gonna do about it eh?!  Right now, I'm going through a rough time. I don't know what I expect of life anymore. I mean, what am I supposed to expect of it! If it's like they say "Life is what you make of it" Well then I wont be going to far. Because I hate life, I hate living, I hate everything about the aspect of breathing and existing. I wish I could cease to exist, yeep : that's it!  As you can read, I am a very bitchy person, who hates people. Bah, not everyone...but, you know who you are the people I DO hate. I am not at liberty to say their names, they would obviously deny that they've been really stupid.  Well, I can always write later...Because now I HAVE to get offline before my Mum goes nuts..! ~Em

      I have now decided that I am going to delete all my other Journal/Blog type things. I'll be keeping this one, my LiveJournal, my melo and my MySpace. Four shouldn't be too hard. But people will have to keep checking and checking. =) Oh well, woop-de-fucking-do for them I don't give a shit. It's not like they actually care. I could die tomorrow and no-one would notice. Except for maybe... Mike. Yeah. He would notice, it would be way to peaceful for him... He's at his place now. Not here. I think he only comes here every two weeks so I won't get too lonesome. Heh. It's alright, I don't care. The only thing I miss is Maxx. Tim's cat. *sob* Him and Lucifer [My cat] got along quite well. But now, I'm stuck with a dog... *GRR* Dog's are nice though. Yeah. Blue is pretty cool.  So, I'll try to update this every couple of days. See if it comes out with anything. =\ Probably not. I really can't spell.

      Weird title, I know... But I'm not even sure myself now-a-days. If someone asked me who I was. I'd say 'Shannon-Emily' But... who 'is' Shannon-Emily. It's such a stupid question! Oooh, who is the girl behind that wretched name? I have no clue. I just consider me... well, me. Just normal. But when people who have known me for a long time, they know I'm not 'normal' But then again... who is normal these days.  I Am...  Small town girl, I am. I don't get out much. I like blue cotton-candy with club soda [Who would have known?] I've always had long hair, I've never cut it short. I've done drugs, and came out of it alive. [Result: I'm fucked up in the fucking head, fuck man!] I had two brother's. An older one and a younger twin brother. I only have one now. Mike, the older brother he's 18. [Xavier August Jean-Louis Beaulne, may you rest in peace] I like to read, I can't read more than one book at a time, otherwise... I get all confused with the story lines and such. I've had pink hair -I swore I knew what I was doing- I like extreme make-up. And clear lip gloss. I hate glasses, and I have to wear them all the time. *Grr* I like emo [No, I'm not emo] Ok, forget that last comment! I don't enjoy labels. Though I am a mix of everything. That;s what I would like to think. I think fast, and I type even faster. I usually end up regretting what I say to certain people. I've made serious mistakes, but it's just basically Live Life And Learn? I am parentless. My mom died when I was young. My dad is some random fucktard. *I hate him* I've been in several different homes across Ontario [It can be a bad thing] But right now, I'm back to VKH. Where I belong! I'm addicted to the internet. Well, not really. Just a bit. I like to drink, not nessicarily 'till I get drunk. But vodka seriously rocks! [Rum & Coke is a must too] I smoke. Too much. I am a perfectionist. I am not afraid to admit I'm perfect! ;) I care for one person and one person only, and that is my dear brother Mike. DUDE, You dissed my pancakes.... in front of Vanny. *insulted stare* How dare you? I am a world known stalker. hehe, Catch me if you can. No one knows what it's like, to be the sad man? I know what it's like. I smile, I laugh and I take prozac. No really. I am suicidal at times. I can get through it without hurting myself most of the time. I am addicted to eyeliner. I like beach towels. The colours... are cool. I am Shannon-Emily. Lesser of two evils maybe?

      I hate you! I wish you could just die! DIE DIE DIE DIE DIE! Going around talking shit about my friends, thinking my brother is SO into you. Well guess what... HE ISN'T! He hates you more than anything in this world. Just stop. Please, stop trying so hard. It's severly annoying. I hate you.  Anyhow... now that that is over. I would like to point out that that is not directed to my brother's girlfriend, Vanny. No way. I love her. =)  My hair hardly smells anymore, just a light sent of C-R-A-P... No more L'Oréal for moi... And I should really go shopping. School is starting in a month and a half...or so. Anyway, I need new clothes! =) I love clothes. I really want a new guitar. Yeah, I really do. But, I'll wait till I have enough money for clothes, school stuff, piercings, SHOES, a tattoo and then MAYBE I'll get a guitar. Or I should just cut my list down. I don't know. =heh, well this was like a 5 minute update. So yeah. Check out my LiveJournal or something I might be updating those soon. Yeah, peace out... SaVVyShay[~]

      No way. I didn't let myself do this. It's not like me, and I know better. *sigh* I miss her so much. Mike got back home today. Oh lord, I actually missed him. And yeah, finally got to see his new piercing, it looks, er... Kind of... Icky right now. Soon, I'll get my lip & eyebrown done. Yeah, that'll be awesome. =) Mike said it doesn't hurt at all, well lemme tell you... your tongue HURTS. It wasn't actually THAT bad, and it didn't get infected all that much. I took it out though. It was just annoying me to no end, having that in my mouth... 24/7 [I knew it was a stupid idea] Meh, there goes 80 bucks to waste. All I have left is my ears, and navel. =\ Anyhow. I have a sunburn. Ouch...  Family is falling apart [Atleast what's left of it]  And it sucks. I haven't known them all that long, and I hate them already. Fucktards...
