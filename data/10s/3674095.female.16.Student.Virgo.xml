      Our freedom can be measured by the number of things we can walk away from.  We cannot walk away from anything we falsely value, including exciting but pointless involvements.  Non-attachment is the secret, and non-attachment is a product of valuing true life above all else.  What a difference it would make if human beings loved their own lives, but instead they love their unconscious illusions, like children who hide forbidden and dangerous toys in the cellar.  The spiritual adult knows how to walk casually away from all that is not worth his attention.   --The Daily Guru

      this one is from friendster..just want to post it..Ãœ        When I stand up for myself and my beliefs, they  call me a bitch.        When I stand up for those I love, they call me a  bitch.        When I speak my mind, think my own thoughts or  do things my own way, they call me a bitch.        Being a bitch means I won't compromise what's in  my heart. It means I live my life MY way. It  means I won't allow anyone to step on me.        When I refuse to tolerate injustice and speak  against it, I am defined as a bitch.       The same thing happens when I take time for  myself instead of being everyone's maid.       It means I have the courage and strength to  allow myself to be who I truly am and won't  become anyone else's idea of what they think  I "should" be.  I am outspoken, opinionated and determined.  I want what I want and there is nothing wrong  with that!  So try to stomp on me, try to douse my inner  flame, try to squash every ounce of beauty I  hold within me.  You won't succeed.  And if that makes me a bitch, so be it.  I embrace the title and am proud to bear it !!!!   B = Babe  I = In  T = Total  C = Control of  H = Herself   B = Beautiful  I = Intelligent  T = Talented  C = Charming  H = Hell of a Woman   B = Beautiful  I = Individual  T = That  C = Can  H = Handle anything
