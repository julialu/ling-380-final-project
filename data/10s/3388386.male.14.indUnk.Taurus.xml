      The new James Bond game is out, and it is fantastic! Everything or Nothing is a must have for every James Bond fan. This is by far the best one since Goldeneye. This game is in third-person view, and has some HOT bond girls! New gadgets, and exotic locations make this a great game. So, when you have an extra $50.00 laying around the house GET IT!
