      I have self injured for ten years now I have thousands of scars and marks on my skin. The last year has been the worst year of my life... I tried to commit suicide 6 times in 5 month how in the hell did I get this way? Why do I have the addiction that I do? Why do I cut so deeply that I bleed for long periods of time? What do I have to live for?

      I have fought the demons of my mind for so long I fear that I have lost all my strength. I have little keeping me from dying, my GF, computer, car and so on but anyway the demons of the heart are now comings of age and the mind is fighting on fronts and I don't know how long I will be able to survive another night
