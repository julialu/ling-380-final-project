      The second entry of my blog.&nbsp; Life in all it's normality.    Two hour delay.&nbsp; The schedule was changed, and I wondered somewhat lost.   On the bus Spencer and Jeremiah were plotting on how to rip out my earings w/o my noticing. So, a normal bus ride.   I'll have to buy tickets next week for Valentines. Going alone isn't looking so hot. Being alone is a frown, especially with this kind of thing.   Well I'm going to run, not literally naturally,&nbsp;being exhausted.

      Two quotes.   "Now it is a strange thing, but things that are good to have and days that are good to spend are soon told about and not much to listen to; while things that are uncomfortable, palpitating, and even gruesome, may make a good tale, and take a deal of telling anyway."   "There is nothing like looking, if you want to find something. You certainly usually find something, if you look, but it is not always quite the same thing you were after."

      Mitch, the Gusta [as Beck and I have taken to calling him recently], is delivering a GQ-gram in&nbsp;Spanish.&nbsp; Dave's being himself and pretending he's secretive.   So I Skipped keyboarding today to go to Millionaire Cafe with "I think that'll do" man.&nbsp; I think he may be the english department head.&nbsp; It was hillarious.&nbsp; Worth the whole trouble of editing those scholastic pieces. [questionable].&nbsp; Missy almost fell out of her seat at several points, not to mention Sarah scaring the waiter half to death when he asked if he could take her plate and she delivered a smack down.

      Somethings are like this: you dont miss them until you realize they're really gone, and you only realize they're really gone until too late.  no. its not like that.    I'm feeling sort of stressed, lots to do before I leave for Japan on sunday. Two weeks off.   I was dragged into doing makeup for a production of The Tempest this weekend.  There was loads of faerie make-up, which was really a blast.  All swirls and flames and such, it reminds me of my Tempest.   I missed a violin lesson, My father can most un-understanding at times, I could see him holding himself back from strangling my already grounded throat.

      I saw this sort of mini-red-and-black-Sean's ass today while spending an evening with Cabe.  He's really a great violinist (Cabe, not Sean's ass).  I took my new carbon fiber bow over to his house.  I was just very proud of it until realized he has a new carbon twice as nice (and expensive).  But in any case, we played that fiddle medley thing for few hours.  I had my technique corrected multiple times.  We watched a Sean Connery movie though, which was less than brilliant.  xxXXxxxxXXxxOOoOOoOo

      all in all the day was a "eh".   I got my report card.  60 in keyboarding.  Zimmerman had said was going to give me 74.  Lovely.   The day evened out overall though, I suppose, because I found out I've won a national scholastic award.  I'm floating on that one.  I'm not sure how my parents will take the 60, I'll deffinately tell them about the award first and then throw in the 60 on the side like.  District orchestra tonight, promises to be boring as hell.    xo

But on up side, I have a Cabe who somehow puts up with me on days like this.

      COTCHED ROOF THATTAGES! So I went to cabe's after trogdor burned down my thatched roof cottage.  Around 4:30.  I had fun meet all the mucho relative types.  They're all very full of hippylumberjackosity.  We played bad-mitten for a while, I, in all my coordination, fell and got soaking wet.  Cabe's sucha tease most of the time.  He kept blowing in my ears at unappropiate times.  Actuualy he was full of unapropriateosity tonight.  We played capture el flago, or, more to the point, Char did.  Cabe and I phsudo-played.  I got home fairly late, but the rents had gone out to some party anyway.  fine with me.     xxxxxooooooooooo   -KIWIOSITY

      If you think then, that I'm trying to be nice,  I'm not.   You must think I'm messing with you. With your life.   I'm not.   I care about you like light through shut blinds.   Maybe you don't remember that?   That you were that light.   You were.   I wanted to make it work, don't think that we didn't try.   We did,  I did and you did.   We tried and it didn't, Cabe,  and I need to pull away now and try to seal myself off so maybe I wont seep back into the place I used to be.   It kills me to read the words there.   That I could hurt you so much is a cold slap to me,  but if I try to make it better for you I make it worse for me.

      To you. Reading his blog is like having someone slam a knife into your stomach.  All I can do is read it again and feel the tears coming.  I wish he had some conception of the way I feel about him, but its not something I can type out into neatly computer balanced single spaced text.   It would be easier, wouldn't it, if words came easier and I could say to him that he hasn't lost me?  That I'm right here.  But its amazing how with just a few words, a touch on the arm, a glance at the ground, and you can lose someone.  I could say  if you're going through Hell, keep going , because isn't that what I would tell him if I wasn't the one who put him there?  Yes, but that's not what's coming out of my lips now.  His fault?  No.  If there was a way I could say this and he would understand than I would say it in an instant.  Mitch? No.  What I said in that kennel, leaning against that locker, eyes to the floor.  What I said with my hand on his arm and my heart in my throat was nothing he would have changed by doing or not doing something differently.  It's impossible to sit here and breathe without wanting to call him and wanting to hear his voice on the other end to tell him that its not his fault, not his fault.  Not Mitch's Fault.  No one's but mine.  And for all the horror I've caused I feel like wrapping my arms around him and letting myself slip back.  But that would be worse for us both and I hope he can see it through the dark blue.

      It isn't that I miss him.  No.  I think its more I miss having someone walk me to math, and call me at night, and give me back my scarf after I left it in the backseat of his car.  Which is sort of silly in a way, because I really haven't had those things for a long time.  But knowing that he doesn't feel the same way, that he isn't out there missing me in the least is what really hurts.  It's what really makes me angry and never seeing him, the fact that he must walk the opposite hallways so that he doesn't see me in the hall.  I hate him and I don't and that makes me all the more angry.

      The day was what it was.  It was single and sort of lonely in a way that I was surprised at because I didn't expect to be lonely this shot around.  Aside from this, I've developed a heavy addiction to my Switchfoot Cd.  I think they could lock me away somewhere with maybe a bag of pretzels and a my Switchfoot Cd and I wouldn't really complain.   Ok, I would.  But thats only because I'm hoplessly complain-ful and not because butter pretzels and Switch aren't enough.   these abundant skies, these abundant skies, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah .  Practice was somewhat pointless today.  I wasn't in any of the scenes so it was mostly sitting around and being amazed and depressed by the greatness and extreme suckiness of the various people we've got in this thing.  I imagine Charlie and Melissa will really be the only two carrying the entire show.  I expect you all to be there anyhow, by the way.  If nothing else, me on a stepstool will certainly be amusing.  xo. ker.

      Another day of Anti-Painting, as Kris would say.  Alumni day and old memories and older friends.  Its amazing how sitting in that stairwell with all the pictures around me should make me feel sad.  But it's that care-free feeling that doesnt exist in my life anymore that was everything that school and those people were about.  Singing and laughing and painting outside on the grass until the bells rang.

      Brad has offered to take Charlie, Joey and I rafting.  Canoeing really.  As brad is involved however, the trip will more than likely involve quite a lot of violence and probably my death.

      I told the denist my tooth hurts when I chew.  And then he charged me $53.00 and told me not to bite down so hard.  Well, at least I missed third period.  Tonight, because I no longer have a life, I ran a while in the rain with my father.  He brought home thai food with his nails painted purple and blue and green.  I helped him take it off with nailpolish remover.  Sometimes I wonder about him.  Aparently, he lost a bet.  So we ate the thai food together in the blue bowls my mother really hates when we use.  Sometimes she hides them behind the rice bowls.  Well, at least she wasn't home to yell.

      Generally, I have found that there is really a very easy formula for good cooking, and that is: take the prescribed amount ginger in recipe and double, or if you're in a really good mood, triple it.  Obviously, if there is no ginger in the recipe, use good sense and estimate.  Or, for better result, overestimate.   This weekend has been particularly inspiring.  I'm not at all sure why, to be honest, but it's really been a relief.  I've done a lot of painting and recently, some writing, and I made my way through the rest of the Pullman book I've been reading.     And I've blogged three times, which is probably a record for me, this blog has been neglected for months.  In any case, I feel very revitalized and ready to have my spirits beaten back down to acceptable levels by Kelley and Imresek for the next few weeks.  Summer is becoming visible though, and that seems to shed new light on everything.

       I'm not sick, but I'm not well.  And I'm so hot, 'cause-   I lost the ring today.  Just a little band of silver that no one would care much about except that I did because Syd bought it for me.  Four years of never letting it leave my finger, and I took it off in art class to make a fucking clay pot.            Josh, Ryan, and I spent a good couple of hours digging through garbage cans of wet clay and came up empty handed.  If it was there, then it slipped through our fingers, and I left the art room with my hand unnervingly light and my mood unnervingly heavy.     And my dentist wonders why I grate my teeth.

      The word is "it's", not "its", Caleb, if you're going to be a nit-picky ass hole. Note yourself.

      I've named him Don Jon because he's a bastard, and because i can no longer walk do to the small tantrum he had on my foot.  I sencerly hope he enjoys the publicity of this, he certainly doesnt deserve it.

      To be honest I really dislike the new blogger set up, to voice my opinion.  They should give you the option to retain the old template.     I discovered e.e. cummings yesterday. line of the day is: "may came home with a smooth round stone  as small as a world and as large as alone." not for any reason more particular than because it flowed into my mind and stuck there.   I think it's nice that Jeremiah's pants have a condom pocket.  How lovely and not at all inappropriate, perhaps it's a German thing.

      I did a painting today of the sky at night, the way it looks laying on the grass with the moon circled in clouds a the forest framing the edge.   I'm not sure I like it, but it has a long way to go still, so perhaps I will in the end.

      Kiss me one more time, and  then turn around, walk away from me, and don't look  back.   And  all I can whisper is Never ask me not to look  back.

      There aren't words.  But I’ll keep the purple blanket forever.  As you walk the streets of China I’ll lay in my bed with it around me, smelling and feeling like a beautiful night under the stars.  As you drift to college I’ll lay in on the couch and curl into it on sick days, or when I miss you most.   A reminder of you.  A memento of bliss.  A souvenir from paradise.

      Mmmm. Ahhhh. (accessive breathing)  "I don't feel this..." (dramatic effect) mmm. Ahhhhh. "is exactly." (tension NOT building) mmm. hmmm. ahh. "Academic."  Thank you, Burget, for that beautiful observation of the obvious.  No, cartoons of the founding fathers are not academic;  They're damn hillarious.

         And when I'm sinking in. . .  Another day in paradise, with the sun and the wind and a kite that liked the ground.  Summer school begins in the morning.  Another wave of six o'clock alarms and hot morning showers.  I'm going to bed.

      A morning of driving my father to Montoursville and listening to another list of all the things that disapoint him about me.  I could have taken it if he hadn't said anything about my paintings.

      I fully enjoyed Geometry today.  It was infinitely better than any of the stress management classes the school offers.  There's something extremely rewarding about telling that man exactly what a jackass he is.  One more day of school, and then it's one week of sweet summer before summer school kicks in.  The well awaited  Search for Johnny  starts filming mid-June.  Rumor has it, the directors like cream-filled doughnuts. wink wink.
