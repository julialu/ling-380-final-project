      Today, my earlier plans were canceled so I hung out with Ashley and Michelle. It was fun. lmao. Okay. Well I'm too lazy to type the whole thing out again but. I'll just list the events in point form: -Met at this park, Ashley and Michelle got there at 5:15. -Went to the creepy Select store and got some drinks. I got a peach/mango Sobe. yummy -Went to my house, played Siren. Thanks to Ashley, I am on the second level. Aww thanks Ashley.  -Then we played Halo. lmao. It was fun running each other over on vehicles. I was about to snipe Ashley on my sniper and she runs in a zig zag. lmao -Went outside, and to the park near the swimming pool. -These sprinklers started gushing out water. They were so big and high up.   -Lmao, Me and Ashley found out that you could move the direction of where the water comes out. I sprayed a little girl. lmao. Then, lmao, I sprayed Ashley, and her hair flew up!! LMAO.. It was funny. Then after that. Ashley wanted revenge, so her and Michelle grabbed me and yea..lol. We were both soaked except for Michelle.  -Then we start to walk back, and we find a baseball bat. Lmao, I throw this rock and Michelle hits it and it was like 3 inches from hitting this truck!!! Lol, I would've ran.  -Then Ashley and Michelle were nice enough to walk me home. Aww..  -I got home at 10:25, and now I am typing this entry again. yep. STUPID IE!   I'm thinking of playing GTA - Vice City. I'm trying to complete the game again since my old file got deleted. I own the mansion now so, It'll probably take 3-4 more days til I complete the whole thing. Well, it depends on how much I play it. Gosh. I'm going to my moms stampede breakfast thingy tomorrow. Ahhh. I have to wake up pretty early. After that, I'm going to millenium park. Its going to be really intimidating/awkward. If my mom wouldn't be watching me then It would be that wierd. Because, If I do a trick or something, she'll be like, "Oh no! Thats dangerous" and stuff like that, and then I wouldn't be allowed to do tricks anymore. sucky. Yep. Home Movies is on. Fin.

I love funny commercials such as these: [Vim Clean commercial]: Its where the mother is in the tub and shes cleaning and it looks like shes in jail but shes really stuck in the tub cleaning it and shes talking to her daughter and stuff. That is funny. [DQ Commercial]: This lady is trying these new MOOOOOlattes and the people who are judging are asking her to give it back, and then she starts running in the little room, and she runs in the window. Its funny. Today, I went to sunridge mall today, and I had to wait half an hour for a blueberry turnover from Arby's. I absolutely loooveee blueberry turnovers!! They are thee bomb! Yep.

      Well, today I woke up at 8:00 a.m. I was really hoping that it would be nice and sunny outside but unfortunately it is  not . This morning, from about 8:00 - 10:00 i guess, I was sooooo bored, so I decided to clean up my whole house, the living room, the kitchen [all the candy and stuff], and my room. Well it looks nice lol I guess but yea. Then after that, I went upstairs and I took a shower. I like warm showers, I despise cold ones. I remember when I went to the Philipines [i spell it wrong all the time] It was sooo hot and all the showers I took were cold ones. Bah!! I really wish it was sunny today. Well since its only like 11:54 a.m., hopefully later in the day it will be sunny. I checked the forecast, today is going to be a mix of sun and cloud and the high for today it 19 degrees. Right now, I'm eating a pogo! yummy. =P .I think somewhere in August I'm going to go to Canmore. Awww, I wish we'd go to Banff because there are so many skateboard shops there.  STUPID WEATHER!!!

      Well, zee, Today I was skateboarding outside with my brother biking on his bmx and we were just minding our own business in the parking lot when this lady comes out and starts scolding us. Shes like, "my little girl needs to sleep" and stuff, and it was just 7. Grrrr. Stupid bitch, if she knew that she was going to move/live by a busy street in a bad neighborhood, then why the hell did she move there anyway dummy. And she doesn't own that so grrrr. w/e Other people live here too, so shes just one little arrogant bitch. okay. Pahaha Anyhooters. Right now, I was just Role-Playing with Ashley. It was hilarious. Oh my. Fin.
