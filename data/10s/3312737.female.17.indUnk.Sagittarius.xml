      I had a lot to do today, I barely had enough time to be on the computer.&nbsp; I had a dental appointment(and I've been told that I'm doing an excellent job of taking care of my teeth^_^), I had to bathe my puppies(Boomer and Spunky, two little pomeranians), I had to go to tap class(we learned drawbacks today!&nbsp; I've been wanting to learn how to do those) and I did a little recording of a new character I got casted as in the fandub project(I got the part of Ken^_^).&nbsp; Now I have to do some last minute packing since I haven't even started.&nbsp; I can't wait to see my family in CA again!

      I made another Digimon music video.&nbsp; It's to the song Children, it's been a favorite dance song of mine since I was very young.&nbsp; I'll have it up later though because I'm too lazy to upload it right now:P &nbsp; I've also got most of my lines in for a fandub project of the 4th movie of Digimon.&nbsp; Just one more line to go.&nbsp; I play the role of Hikari and an extra character at the beginning of the movie.&nbsp; Another role is still pending.

      Well I finally got to go to PA, but it was only one town we visited.&nbsp; It was called Intercourse. Interesting name, I bought an even more&nbsp;interesting souvenir t-shirt.&nbsp; Anyways, it was a small town.&nbsp; I got to see the Amish riding in their buggies.&nbsp; I can't take a picture of them though, since they believe that&nbsp;if you take&nbsp;their picture, you're taking their soul.&nbsp; I respect their belief.&nbsp; There was a lot of farmland and beautiful sights.&nbsp; I passed by this small waterfall while crossing a bridge, it just looked so gorgeous.&nbsp; I can't say I was too crazy about the country smell though.&nbsp; It was nice visiting a small community like that.&nbsp; Maybe we can see more of PA another time, and maybe I can take some pictures too.

      Tomorrow I'll be gone for the whole day visiting Pennsylvania, that's if my parents don't postpone the trip again like last time.&nbsp; If there's one thing I don't like about my parents, its that they always make plans to go take me somewhere and they never do.&nbsp; Well, we'll see...

      My great grandmother died of it, both my maternal grandparents have it, and now my mom has been diagnosed with it.&nbsp; I have a greater chance of getting it than the average person because diabetes runs in my family.&nbsp; I fear that later on in life that I will have it as well.&nbsp; I don't have the healthiest diet and I'm not very active.&nbsp; All I can do now is change my habits and hope for the best.

      A while back I made a Digimon music video to the remix of Brave Heart, which was the evolution song in 01.  I'm hoping that it shows up on my blog.  If you can't see it then please leave a comment stating so.

      Tomorrow morning at 8 my parents are taking me to Pennsylvania for the whole day.  Also, I'll be flying back to California for a couple of weeks on July 22 to August 18.  That'll make three states that I've been to, 47 to go...

      My cable modem has been acting funny lately.  It seems to be working fine during the day, but in the evening I can't get online!  I think maybe I've been caught.  I've been using it ilegally.  My parents haven't been paying for it.  My stepdad said he called to shut it off, but it was never shut off so I've been using it for free.  Gah!  I feel like a crook!  Oh well.  Que sera, sera.  EDIT: Yay!  I finally got my tentomon bullets and marineangemon button to show up!  They wouldn't show up earlier cuz of the urls that I entered into the html tags.
