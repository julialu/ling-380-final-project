       God damn I'm so bored. What the fuck..... My dad wakes me up at 8:30 and I can't go back to sleep. Okay, I am going to type one of my poems and you are going to tell me if it sucks or not.      10 More Minutes      10 more minutes of this life   I just can't handle all this strife   I need somewhere to rest my head   Maybe I should go to bed      Swallow pills to say goodnight   For once my room is just too bright   So many times I sat and cried   You'll never know how hard I tried

       I feel really bad because yesterday was my brothers birthday and my mom got completely shit faced. Luckily he is only five and he didn't know that his mom was drunk but that hardly makes up for it. Whatever, at least I got him the one thing he really wanted for his birthday, I really lucked out because I didn't know that he wanted it.

       I have to go to my moms today which sucks because I am going to be there through Wedsday. (I hate my mom) But whatever, I have to go do laundry because I don't have any clean clothes.       Oh, and I am going to valleyfair with the guy I like (who doesn't like be back) and our friend (who told me he doesn't like be back). It should be fun, but it would be even more fun if he liked me back. :(

      I asked my friend if his friend, who is also mine, liked me. And he said he didn't think so, so I am kind of kicking myself for asking. I guess I really should have just let myself wonder. Whatever.

       Yeah, its been a couple of days I believe. I didn't really have a whole lot to say I guess. My ex is moving away tomorrow. I went to her house to say goodbye today. I also got my room clean, which is nice seeing as how it was a disaster. whatever, I guess I have nothing to say now either.

      Its a priday noght and I'm going to spend it with these snotty kids I hate... I HATE babysitting. Well atleast the woman pays well. I suppose she knows her kids are bitches. Anyway, anyone who is reading this must come to the Depot on the 13th because my friends band is playing there. They are a really great punk band, though technically they would be a grunge band if grunge still existed... meh

      This guy just IMed me out of no where... a little weird... but whats weirder was I thought that it was my friends Screen Name, but I guess not. Just some dude from Mass. Isn't it weird how things happen like that? You think you understand how things work and than all of a sudden you blink and everything has changed.

       Today I am going to start posting everyday, I don't really know why I am telling you all this. (By 'you all' I mean you Aaron... but maybe you could tell your friends about my site?????!) Anyway I guess its just something to do, but whatever.... to me I see it as someplace I can just clear my head and not have to worry about someone judging me. Anyways enough with the mushy crap. Peace  OUT!!!!
