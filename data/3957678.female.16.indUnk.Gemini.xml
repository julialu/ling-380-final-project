      I am going to sleep in a minute but I knew you'd succumb to the masses eventually.    And I hear Heredia really DID beat his girlfriend and possibly raped someone!  Nice!

      I don't like templates, but am too lazy to deal with Blogger HTMLing.  I'll survive.

       Inspired by the blogs of June and Jennifer, yes.  Poor, poor Javier:  "I wish I knew what was wrong," Vazquez said. "My last three starts, I felt so bad when I was there, like I didn't know what I was doing. Today my control was fine. My control is always going to be fine. But right now, things are not going right and I'm just getting beat. I just feel like I don't know what I'm doing out there. I don't know how to explain it."  :'(  Can we trade Jason Giambi?&nbsp; Please?&nbsp; For Randy Johnson?&nbsp; Seriously, take Jason!&nbsp; TAKE THE WHOLE FARM!! Dad and Uncle&nbsp;in the hunt for Yankees tickets!&nbsp; Looks like games vs. Oakland and Toronto when I'm going to be in NY -- Zito, please?&nbsp; Mmmm.  &nbsp;  Moose better be off the DL by then.  &nbsp;  I promise my upcoming entries will be more interesting.   Hah:  &nbsp;  &nbsp;

      I don't really think I have the will to keep this blog going.  Sigh.  Just tell me never to become a baseball analyst.  Or something.  Maybe if the Yankees gave me something to complain about, it wouldn't be so bad.  Oh yes.  Starting pitching.  Needs help.  Although, I'm honestly so tired of thinking about it.  Just pray that Brown and Moose turn their seasons around in time for the playoffs.
