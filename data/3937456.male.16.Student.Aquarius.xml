        urlLink www.toriyamasworld.com     I have seen about 40 episodes so far and it has been one of the best shows that I have ever seen. If you like anime then you'll like this. I dont want to go into to much discussion about it because I might ruin some of the parts for you but if you'd like to know more then here's a link.

        If you do not know about guildwars or have never heard about guild wars and you like to play mmorpg's then you'll love this game. First off if you like Finall Fantasy online but dont like the subscription fees. Then you'll really love this game because it's ONLINE FOR FREE. . Thats right you no longer have to play relentlessly online just because you have a time limit, you can get online and play anytime you wish. One of the down falls to many online games is that you are on a specific server and your friends may be on another. What makes this game better than many others is that all the servers are seamlessly connected. That means that anyone who is online anywhere in the world who is playing the game is in the same world as you. You might think that this might cause a lot of trouble when or killing monsters due to kill stealing but no more. Credit is givin where credit is due. No one can just come in and take your kill. I'm not sure how this is done quite yet because the game is still in the final stages of developement. One thing that I do know is that every player or group will be given their own personalized map. That means that you or your group will have a map that is all your own and that is different from everyone elses. The final thing that I believe really makes this game different from all the rest is that it streams data directly to your computer. Meaning you will get new opening videos new content while playing the game, the posibilities are endless. I hope that this peeks your interest just a little bit.  Please comment on some of your ideas, questions, or just what you think.
