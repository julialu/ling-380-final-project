      This will be sort of like... about my life in band... like.. dedicated to SwiSS WiNdS ? sigh...  Tay actually let us play for serenade... then...now... sec 4s can only go for sat afternoon band prac. but like tt, we only have 1 pathetic practice before the concert.... ? how to? for us to pass out too... wat the... it would be... totally throwing SWISS's reputation down the drain! sigh... then... we are ' kicked' out of the bandroom when we try to go some other days.. sigh...   sigh... swiss winds... haiz... why?... SerEnAde is very important to us... esp the sec 4s..   that's when we pass out... the day.... that.... the day... that we.... leave the band... never to step into the bandroom, as an actual member anymore... we become guest, visitors... ex seniors... and then... slowly.... our voices, playing, faces, each... slowly... is being eroded away... slowly... we will become the forgotten... the forgotten batch... of seniors... from 2001-2004.... the days we spend together are now merely in our memories... somewhere... deep... at the back of our heads.... how many of us... can actually take this memories out? from the storage tank? how many of us can still do it... after the many years have passed... and the feeling slowly... almost naturally disapear... before you know it... and when we try to find the feeling back... its like... too late...  sigh... things will change... and when it does... the changes are great.... so great... that it takes you in surprise.. and you have no way to escape... to fight... all you can do... is to retreat... and retreat... and retreat.. and when you try to fight back once again... it causes you to fall back more...  sigh...   sigh... so tired of all this.. we always fight... but problems keep coming... and coming... one wave after the other... each time getting stronger.. forceful -er and... and its drives us further... and further away... away from where we want to be... and going to where they think we want to be... is it fair ? no.... but then again.... is there anything in the world, that is really fair ?   soon... all this... everything... will become memories... sigh... then... why hurt us now? .... sigh..   Band. the place where i gone through alot, sometimes, hate it, but still... love it.. the place where i 'grown up' in... the place i made my most important friends, and learned important things and skills tt i will not find in the textbook and classrooms... a place where we enjoy the music together. a place we stuck through thick and thin. a place we saw the different sides of a person.. the place which taught us things we will never learn in exams,class, remedials, lessons. watever. a place, where i will never forget in my whole life....

       What's love? When you are together with that special someone, you pretend to ignore that person. But when that special someone is not around, you might look around to find them. At that moment, you are in love.  Although there is someone else who always makes you laugh, your eyes and attention might go only to that special someone. Then, you are in love.  Although that special someone was supposed to have called you long back, to let you know of their safe arrival, your phone is quiet. You are desperately waiting for the call! At that moment, you are in love. If you are much more excited for one short e-mail from that special someone than other many long e-mails, you are in love. When you find yourself as one who cannot erase all the messages in your answering machine because of one message from that special someone, you are in love. When you get a couple of free movie tickets, you would not hesitate to think of that special someone. Then, you are in love. You keep telling yourself, "that special someone is just a friend", but you realize that you can not avoid that person's special attraction. At that moment, you are in love. While you are reading this page, if someone appears in your mind, then u are in love with that person.

      失眠一定会按时来敲门  风只捉弄刚失恋的人  你走后我再没有锁门  数着风声 吹走爱的可能   在爱之前无所谓平等  地球静止在那晚九点整  我肩膀放下宠爱你的责任  回忆的重量 却愈变愈沉(欲罢不能)   没有力气 再回味甜蜜 我扛着过去 像只渺小蚂蚁  最后力气 我留给忘记 你早飞出我世界里   没有力气 把从前抹去 爱过的证据 蔓延好几千里  最后力气 我留给放弃 你早飞出我世界里   没有力气 再回味甜蜜--

      ‘Swiss Winds…’, I screamed the loudest I ever did… It was the last time I get to say that after falling out… the second loudest was probably when we got gold, and cheered outside the Victoria Concert Hall…   Yesterday was 02 July 2004… the day we held the Swiss serenade… the day the sec 4s leave the band… During the interval… we were getting ourselves ready for Soleado… the Saxophone quartet piece… as the band got ready to line up, Carmen, Jie Hui, Jun Xian and me held hands and said our prayers... something Carmen created… then… we looked up… at each other… Jie Hui was opposite me… Her eyes… were red… and watery… then… the two of us had tears falling down our cheeks… Then… We hugged each other… even Jun Xian also… For that moment… we didn’t noticed the band… it was only us… they made a lot of noise lining up, and we were almost… in our own world… they went out… and we waited behind the backstage… we were feeling so much then… anxiety… nervousness… we want to do well… we want to play the most perfect piece… Soleado… we encouraged each other… cheered for ourselves even… ‘ 1, 2, 3… SAXOPHONIC!’ we said…   Taking deep breaths… we went out… onto the stage… I realized it was filled with people… true… it may not be a full house… but then… it is more then a 1000 seater hall… One by one… Ya Ting announced our names… the applause meant a lot… then… we played… it was… simply… one of the most perfect times we played… we stood up… bowed… and went back… and… Zheng Xuan and Melvyn came up to the stage… and gave us flowers…   Then… it was almost the end of the concert… YMCA was played… halfway through the piece… I couldn’t help it… tears start forming in my eyes… had to control so much… at the very thought of… playing my last concert, the last performance in Swiss winds, and the last time I can play with the band… I couldn’t help it… we went off the stage… and I felt so much like crying… I saw Jie Hui… she cried… As I opened my mouth to tell her not to cry… the tears I have been keeping back came… we hugged each other… and cried… cried and cried… Zhi Yuan was pretty surprised, I think… he was like… !!! may cry le!!! I couldn’t help it… then my juniors came… I ‘grabbed’ them… hugged them so tightly…   Then… stopped crying… went to take photos with ken, zheng xuan, and Melvyn… then… went to fall in… sigh… as soon as Le Qi and Regina hugged me… and told me to take care… my tears came flowing down again… then… Carmen and me went to hug Zhi Xian…   Then… we reached school… Lily, Ya Ting and Jie Hui was talking to us… then they cried… then I start crying too… then... ‘ Swiss Winds’  and… its over…  Sorry people… I only write my feelings first… next time then write the others ba…

      yup... sorry for those who are all tired of the band talk... probably my last few entries on swiss winds anyway...  In an hour's time, it will be 02 of july 2004.. very soon... in about 20 hours time... it will be my last performance.. for the band... tml at 1.10pm... it will be the last time... the last time i step into the band room, as a member of the band... as a senior of swiss winds...  memories... everything that happened.. ever since sec 1... until now... sec 4... i remember the times we shared together...  When i was in my pri. sch, getting my results, the sch my parents want me to go, is Bpghss.. but.. i purposely opposed them, ans went to swiss.. as i stepped into the doorsteps.. i knew i had to make a choice... was it guides or the band... i went to the band room... for the first time, i went to a CCA room and felt so much... i knew then... i want to join the band... went for the audition.. i remember my senior said to me:' you are going to be a saxophonist! you can't run away from it!' and true enough... i play the sax.. my choice for instruments, were much different though... flute was my first choice, then the clarinet... i nv took the seniors word seriously...  however... i am now very glad that i came to the saxophone section... it rocks totally.. haha... although our seniors didn't care for us that much, we still did our best... bonds became stronger... through band camp 2001, where we had our midnight drill, ken to take us for drill, in the sun or shade.. the toughest kind of drill we had got.. then... i went to the bari sax.. sigh... i hated the instrument at first... but gradually... i like it... more and more..  west malaysia tour 2002.. it was an eye opener for me... the trainings we had, to prepare... was really... straining... we had practises practically 7 to 7pm... but when we were there... we were great, fanstastic... bonds between pple were much stronger...  serenade 2002... i remembered... i was the one who screwed up saxophonia.. i was very guilty.. our sec 4s 02 left us... the batch where even the sec 4s would be very friendly to even to the lower sec..  then... SYF Central Judging 2003... on the first day, last band for the morning.. our performance was simply... S T U N N I N G.. when we went out, the judges had actually made the effort to tell us that we did a fanstastic job on Blue Shades... they clapped for us... even when we were out of VCH... FinALLy... at 5pm... we went back for the results... SWISS COTTAGE: GOLD! We ScreaM! We ShOuTED! We LaUghEd, We HuGGED, Congragulated each other... and we cried... all our hard work was worth it... all the practices that don't seemed to end... that takes up my time... that cause me to feel so tired..and desperate to give up... i am glad we hung on... this was where all our relationships starts to at stronger... the force was so strong... that it maybe like twins inseperable...  then... fullerton hotel was a great experience for all of us... it was simply wonderful... to play soleado for the first time, without due notice... to see the ambassador dance to our 'waltzing with strauss'... it was the best...  Band Tour 2004.. it was even much more better than the previos one... here... we were the seniors... every performance was almost close to perfection... the applause.. the cheers... the look that tell us.. we are good... here... i also became closer friends with many pple... and i know, that the friendships formed during this tour will be unforgettable...   finally... SwiSS SeRenADe 2004... now... its my turn to go... my turn to leave... never to return, as a band member again..  although deep in my heart, i know... i will always be a member of the swiss winds... the strong bonds forged... the hardships we went through together, the scoldings, praises everything... it was together...  Memories... after the concert... it will be memories... kept deep in me... i will remember... i will... evverything... i hate leaving... but then... there's no banquet that doesn't end... isn't it... leaving is because there are new beginnings for us... i hope the end of this chpt of story of the swiss winds 2001-2004 will mean there's a even greater begining from the rest of them...  jia you swiss winds! my cca, my band... it is where all of us, will belong..
