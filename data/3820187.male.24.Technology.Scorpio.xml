        Its been since years that with every rainy season i get in to treking business.  Peth , peb, Matheran,Bhima Shanker,Chinchoti are some of the all time favourite places.    What to bring   Pack sack  Raincoat or poncho (downpours are frequent)  Boots or comfortable walking shoes Sandals,  &nbsp;for river crossings or around campsite Warm clothing,&nbsp;(a fleece or sweater)  Hat for the sun Sleeping bag Flashlight Sunscreen  Water bottle  Plastic bags for documentation, camera    and a good dose of humor   Whenever you take a halt while climbing, always follow a golden rule.  Once you start leaving the place and get back to climbing, move little distance and then see back at the halt place to check if at all you are forgetting anything out there.  &nbsp;
