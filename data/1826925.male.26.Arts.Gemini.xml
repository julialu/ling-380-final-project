      Family... Hmph.  I ask a brother to help me with a project on my house, and he tells me "No. I don't want to do any work in that house. Dad asked me not to do anything in there. So I won't."  Well...I guess since I have ZERO ties to that side of the family since the divorce, I don't have to help THEM anymore. Nor talk to them.  Good....less cards and gifts to worry about.  THEN, I go tell another member of my family that I want to start looking for work elsewhere and she just gives me grief and attitude. Way to want better for your son. I am sorry...I am above my current job. I have the training and the education to be doing something much more on my level. But it will be tough because of the fuckin economy we are in now. "NUKE THOSE FUCKS and those who support them and there damned towels." is what I say...but that's just me.  Mmmm...Republican!

      Well...how was my day off spent?  WORKING!  Here is my plan...we hit the banks, but DON'T GO FOR THE SAFE. NEVER GO FOR THE SAFE.  If Patrick Swayze taught me anything, it's that you NEVER GO FOR THE SAFE.  Oh yea...that and how to dance properly. But he can't take all the credit, Kevin Bacon had a big influence on how I dance.  Juilliard should have been my first school of choice.  Wait.  Hold on a tic...  I can't dance. What the hell am I talking about?

      Today was a pretty good day at work!  I really like the new boss... yet there are so many who don't.  Wonder what that says about me!!! :)   So all of us department managers, along with the Inventory Management Associates and the Assitant Managers met with New Manager and he gave us the "How it is gunna be" talk, which i was all for!!!  Anway...after the meeting, I am walking out, and he pulls me to the side, which can be rather scary... And he tells me that he is going to hold me as a leader among the other department managers. He feels that I always have the right answer and have a positive outlook on my job and the jobs i give to those who work for me.   He carried on for a bit, but after the week I had last week...It was so good to hear that!!!:)  Anyway...I am gunna get some work done around the house. Oh, and if you want to send me money...please do!!! :)

      Today is Saturday, August 23 2003 and this is Day 1 of  Rants of The Carl.   First I would like to say thank you for checking out what is on my mind today. But I have to appologize.... I have no mind today. You see...today is a saturday, and I don't have to be at work. So I am couchin it with Danielle, watchin Phone Booth, then picking up her brother to go see FREDDY Vs. JASON.  Those of you who know me, know I LOVE me the Freddy Kruger!  Well, I must go, but I leave you with these words wisdom...       With the rebuilding of Iraq, the Sobig.F Worm destroying computer systems, and America's Power supply on empty, we have to stop and ask ourselfs this one important morality question that has plaqued mankind throughout the past century... Why the hell is Charlie Brown bald at 10 years old?

      Well I have been working overnights for what seems like a blizillion weeks already, and seem to have a katrillion more to go. BUT...there is a silver lining for this week. On Wed, the Seasons Premiere of SMALLVILLE hits the screen. Now, I shouldn't be too excitied because I lived it. AND on Saturday I am going to Rhode Island to see my buddy Scott. So that will be a nice turn of events.  But now, it is 2:40pm and I must get my beauty sleep. Because all of you The Carl fans know...This hotness I carry with me must rest to shine.

      Friends, Romans, Countrymen, lend me your ears. I come to bury Caesar, not to praise him. That is Shakespeare, and it is hard to understand. But what it translates into is "I am fuckin tired. I have been awake for about 30 hours, and the electricians are in the house now doin work and takin measurements. Lots of work gunna be done. This house is going to be great.  Expensive.  But with the networking, and the new lines, it ups the value about $20,000. Nice money right there. AND I GET A NETWORK.  So now I will just have to be a gaming geek and invite people over to play dorkie games. DANIELLE WILL LOVE THAT! :) Ok, I am going to go zone out until these guys leave...then pass out. THEN GET UP AND WORK ALL NIGHT AGAIN. "YAY" says The Carl as he scratches his eye and looks at the wall.
     

    


25,September,2003



       
      Ok, so I didn't feel that having to work overnights for a month and working on my house was enough for me so I've taken on another large project.  I have begun the rebuilding of www.exit33productions.com WHAT IS WRONG WITH ME.

      I really have to admit, I hate working overnights. It messes up my sleep, makes me cranky, and worse yet, makes me sick. So here is what I am thinking: You The Carl fans that have money, can pay me a small fee of $50,000 a year and I will just hang out at your house, at you job, or around town so you look better. Who wouldn't want that. Your very own The Carl to say is you bud! Sorry ladies, I am spoken for so I can't do anything more than hang out with you. Well, not for only $50k a year, anyway ;) So now I know you are sitting there asking yourself, "What the hell does this great idea have to do with "Ol' Huckleberry Finn" as his title states"? Well let me tell you... Not a damn thing. I just happen to have it on right now (because the remote is too far away) and it is driving me mad. HOLY CRAP...They are breaking out in song. That is my cue to shut down and goto bed. Until next time... Same The Carl Time, Same The Carl Channel.

      So I was sitting here, watching the Bobby De Niro and Rob Williams movie... What? Don't give me a hard time. I can call them Bobby and Rob. We are close. YES WE ARE. We play poker every Friday. Well, I wouldn't say "EVERY friday" but maybe every other Friday. Actually because of the busy schedules, it is down to about once a... OK. NEVER. I Never met them. Are you happy? You've made me feel like an ass. Hope you are happy.    WHAT.  YOU ARE?  You bastard child of Andy Dick. Anyway, what I was originally going to say was I am watchin the movie, Awakenings with ROBERT De NIRO & ROBIN WILLIAMS and it helped me realize a very important thing. I am hungry so I am gunna get something to eat. Thanks for letting me share.

      Do I really have to elaborate on how tired I am? Ok, here it goes: 1st, Danie gets home and demands that I make her food. So, as all you The Carl fans know, The Carl never gives in. So I made her watch a full hour of That 70's Show, and I made a PB&J Sandwich and she made us Ravioli.                                                               mm, Ravioli. Then after Watson some more TV, I left for work.  And after a night of VERY hard work, I get home to sleep. And that is about where I am now. In bed, falling asleep. So until next time, This is The Carl saying, "I like Monkeys."

Wait...If I have this time machine, wouldn't it make more sense to go back, and win tonights Power Ball, or what ever it was! Wait a minute, why stop there. Let me go back even further than that...I will invent EVERYTHING. Oh man... People would walk around all the time talking about how "That's the best thing since The Carl made sliced bread."  Wow...I will own the world.  I can stop the birth of so many of the people that cause harm in this world...Like Cher.   ok, Now I am going to go burn my house so I can get the insurance. G'd Nite.

      It is 11:58 in the evening. I should be sleeping. But alas, I am not. But instead I am looking at my designs for the continuation of the tattoos I have now. And I just have to say...DAMN I WISH I WAS BIGGER. I would look so much better with what i designed. But, since all ma ladies are all like "NO THE CARL..WE LOVE YA THE WAY YOU ARE... DON'T EVER CHANGE." I can't really let them down. I mean, they ARE why I am here...or is it They are here for me??? Hmm.. Doesn't matter.  Oh, and for those of you who don't know me that well...By "Ma Ladies" I mean the ones that aren't really there. Though Danielle is happy with the way I am...but she's insane anyway...I mean hell...she is with me ain't she?  Ok. It is now 12:01 in the morning.

      I know you have been wondering where I have been. Well, you don't have to worry anymore. I am back.  WOOOOOEEEEEEE... What a week. Worked hard, played little.  Though...today, I saved the life of a squirrel. I took ma lady to her doctor, and as we were walking in, some people were standing at the door looking concerned. When we approached, I noticed there was a baby squirrel stuck under the heavy door.  So I took over, and with the help of a nurse, got it out.... then all the super hot nurses were like "WOW...You're a hero, can we strip naked and rub ourselves up and down your leg?"  Of course I declined. Yet, they still stripped down to their underwear and chased me all around the neighborhood, where more people joined in, and I even accedently knocked over an old man in crutches, who also join chase......  Wait....no....THAT WAS A BENNY HILL EPISODE. Ok...so i did help the baby squirrel and they thanked me and called me a hero, but there wasn't any nudity...OR WAS THERE ? ? ? ;-) Oh yea.....when it was all over, I turned around to say something to Danielle, and she was like a half mile away because of the big scary squirrel!

       - There is a game I have become addicted to. It is known by the masses as "Bookworm" and it can be found on http://games.yahoo.com.  Good game.  - I have seen Gangs of New York about 7 times, and I still love it.   - Why do I remember the friends that I owe money too, but can't remember who owes me money?  - What the hell is a  supercalifragilistic ?  - Dispite how kind you may think you are, you are still heartless. Why? You have the nerve to ask me why?  Because in a movie, when the lead character dies, you feel sad, but when the no name extra in the background takes a stray, you don't care one bit. He probally had a family, you heartless bastard.........Don't talk to me. -I have to be at work soon. I really don't understand why I have to go. With the amount of money various people owe me, i can take a couple weeks off...If they'd pay it back already.

      Ok, so I am taking a nice peaceful nap before Danielle gets home. But a few towns over her mother is watchin a report about a tornado warning and i guess they said something along the lines of "Carl's house" so she warns Danielle, who of COURSE calls me to wake me up because of the evil tornado...     ...then after I fall back asleep I start dreaming that my true love, my car, was under water, and BOY I WAS PISSED. Ok, then when the water came down, my car had floated infront of someone's driveway and they had me ticketed and booted. GRRRRR...then my lawyer was more concerned with his partner who was murdred and all the news would talk about were rats that floated into sewer drains...WHERE ELSE DO THEY GO...WHAT ABOUT MY CAR? MY CAR IS DESTROYED, BOOTED, AND TICKETED. I AM FURIOUS...but wait, just then, in real life, and yet again, Danielle calls and wakes me up. BUT my feelings in the dream crossed over into reality. GRRR

      BREAKING NEWS... The Carl has broken off his long friendship with Britney Spears. "I can understand her obsession with me, and I don't blame her. But I cannot allow her to continually attempt more than friendship because my heart belongs to Danielle," said Carl while attending a luncheon with President Bush, who often seeks The Carl's political advice ever since joing politics on October 5th, 2003. Britney was seen outside Carl's former place of employement, The Home Depot. "I can't give up. He means the world to me. I had to call Madonna by his name for weeks just to be able to kiss her. I don't know what to do." This is not the first time Carl had to break a woman's heart. Danielle's mother, Laurie, who was dangerously obsessed with The Carl after first meeting him, was taken to a mental hospital on the peak of a far away mountain where it always rains. After her release she was seen outside The Carl's livingroom window. But being the nice guy that he is, he did not call the police. He just released the dogs on her.      Ms. Spears outside Bridgewater Home Depot after The Carl Broke off their friendship because of her obsession with him.

      The Carl was caught yet again with the woman he promised to stay away from as seen in the picture below.  With the online battle between The Carl's girlfriend, Danielle, and his mistress, Ms. Spears, this is a horrible time for TC and Spears to be seen together last Saturday at a ceremony honoring The Carl's 25 years of being just so damn hot.  In a recent interview, Ms Spears told Barbara Walters that she does not care what Danielle says or threatens, she is determined to win over The Carl's Heart. Meanwhile, Mr. The says that they will always be just friends and he has no plans of leaving Danielle for her. Danielle will not return our calls.

      Lady Luck is proving to be a diseased whore... While making the kazilblilions stripping, a jealous wannabe stripper who would not give his name, dug deep into The Carl's past and found an old trading card that forced Chipendale's to let T.C. go. "We cannot have any thing like this in our upscale business," said a Chipendale's spokesperson. The image below was one that The Carl did not think would ever come back to haunt him. But because he is so cool, The Carl took it all in stride as he moved onto his next adventure...Life's a garden, dig it.

NOW...Saturday I work from 8pm to 6am and then get a 'nap' from 6:30 until 11:30.  Then, goto a Christining and then Danielle's grandparents' house, get home at 7:30 AND PASS OUT. WTF...Why am I going to bed at 7:30. Just call me pappy.

      So the other morning, I had the  CRAZIEST  dream. Danielle and I had a baby boy. THe birth took place in my mom's luncheonette, and even though it was Danielle's baby, she wasn't there for the birth (Selfish). Now, I have a weak stomach and couldn't cut the cord, so I asked my mom to do it, and she put the baby on tin foil and placed him on the grill, turned to me and said "Cooking the cord makes it cut easier." Then I took the baby to see his mother, and on the way passed a house where Laurence Fishborne and Whoppi Goldburg were yelling from windows that they will never come out, to the nazi soldiers below. I got to Danielle and we were happy together. We were looking at our new baby and I noticed his eyes were each half blue and half brown. After I pointed it out, the baby actually said (which for some reason didn't shock me in the dream) "Oh yeah, dad, watch this" and began to 'tune' his eyes back and forth like a dial making them more blue then more brown. This too, did not seem odd to me. Now I didn't drink, snort, or smoke anything...but this was the dream I had.  Oh...and the kid...Looked EXACTLY like me. And I swear on everything I hold sacred in my life (My hair) that this dream really took place.   LOOK, IT IS BABY CARL!

      In the latest news, Hugh Jackman has been deported back to Australia and The Carl has been set to take over in the next installment of X-Men, this time, loosely based more on The Carl's life, where all follow him, instead of following the story of the comic. "We feel that the movie public would rather see some of The Carl, with blades in his fists, than that comic,"  says one exec, "Many people think that this is a major gamble, since the public knows him more as Superman than Wolverene."  But in a recent movie goer survey, 99% said they look forward to this, the other 1% was actually Hugh Jackman.  What do you think?

Err....maybe we can just start with Smallville Season 1.   :)  And how do i know she will want to do this...CAUSE I AM THE CARL...And Rule over ALL.

      Being The Carl is not easy. He is surrounded by controversy at all times. From yesterday's photo of The Carl and Skelator to today's headline news that has him defending himself to his loving girlfriend.  Today, the paparazzi that follows the Carl around caught him and his mistress, Britney together on the dance floor.        Message from The Carl: "Danielle, she means NOTHING to me. NOTHING. You are the one I love... and can you believe that she wants you and I to join her in the bedroom. I was appalled. There is NO WAY I would ever do that.  Unless you wanted to, I mean :)

      Everyone knows that Carl loves Danielle. They also know of his affair with former Mickey Mousketeer, Britney Spears. But, not many knew that Mr. The was engaged to P diddy's ex, J-Lo.  The and J-Lo kept their relationship silent until he dumped her so that he can dedicate all his love to his number one girl.... His three legged cat, Tripod. With yet another heart broken, The Carl has moved on to destroy another life, Tom Cruise.

      I was a little unhappy with the nose that mother nature gave me (she's a whore anyway) so I went to go see one of the most experienced plastic surgeons out there... Michael Jackson's. And boy oh boy, do I reccommend him to anyone. Look how hot I am now!

      Happy Candy day everyone! Hope all had an enjoyable night out. My day kicked ass. And wait'll you see the pics of my costume...kick ass. Danielle's too.  You wanna talk about amazing! The night was off to a good start but The Carl had a wee bit too much substance in his system and mixed the wrong stuff....and got REALLY sick. (Sorry but there will be no pictures of this!) But without all the details, all I can tell all you The Carl fans is one thing...I have the best girlfriend in the world. Hands Down.  It's gotta be tough being the girlfriend of The Carl. All I know, is she is amazing and perfect. Even if she doesn't know how to cook my favorite meals ;) More to come...

      As all of you are aware, The Rants have become an International Hit.  From the coast of California to the hills of Switzerland and from the skate board punks of Seattle to the Samurai Warriors of Japan, The Carl is now a pop culture icon. But with his very level head, The Carl doesn't let the fame get the better of him. In fact, one of his favorite fans is his nephew John, who has started his own  urlLink Rants Page . So to show everyone that he doesn't have an ego, The Carl had his friends in the Comic Book world put his nephew into a well known comic strip to show how much he cares.

      Well, not only will they be making Xmen 3 with The Carl, but they just announced that there will be a PART 2 of Pirates of the Caribbean. And The Carl will be joining the cast. Johnny Depp said he is a little worried people will only be seeing it for The Carl and not the story! Orlando Bloom thinks his joining the team will double sales. The Carl, already in character, said, "Arrrrr. Tis gunna be a scream."  OH That Carl...So witty!

      To everyone:      Merry Christmas to my Jesus loving friends, Happy Chanukah to our Moses loving friends, and Happy Carlmas to everyone that is reading this. Today was a fun, great, then agrivating day. Santa treated me well, even though the fat bastard didn't give me my motorcycle, and I had a great breakfast with my father's side of the family and an enjoyable visit to my mom's house...Thanks for the kick ass stuff mom...and even had a blast with Danielle's family, even though I had to smack her aunt around. (Swear...don't let her tell you it was the other way around, who do you believe, anyway!) But then I got a call that really agrivated me....one of those calls that makes you say "Fuck them."  All I know, is if you need me to help you with a very trying time in your life, always feel free to call on me like these people did...but then if someone else 'comes home' and you suddenly don't need me anymore...don't fuckin call me because you need help with something again. And then if ya ever get mad at me...remember one thing, I won't care. You earned that much.  With that actual rant out of the way, I do wish you all a happy holiday, whatever it may be that you celebrate. Please be safe this coming week, and I hope you all have a WONDERFUL new year.           Your Friend,       The Carl

      There is a stupid head guy I work with. But to protect his doody face identity, we will call him Till Berhune. Today, the vending machine took my dollar. So, I told Bill..err..I mean Till... and do you know what that sticky faced poo poo said to me? HE HAD THE NERVE TO SAY "Yeah, So?"  SO??? IT WAS MY DOLLAR! So, to show that I am not bitter, I desided to put a picture of Till in his night class up on the web. Take that TILL.      (but I'm not bitter.)

      Well ladies, gentleman, and crew of BRMS... The Carl's new favorite movie has hit theatres nationwide.  The Butterfly Effect  with Ashton Kutcher. Now, because of his obsession with traveling in time to change the past, The Carl once again traveled into the movie to destroy Ashton and steal his ability. But, even though The Carl over powered Ashton, he still allowed him to live because it turns out that they have something in common...     They both like Tacos.

      So I woke up at my usual 3:15am only to find it was yet another cold morning with some snow on the ground. Now we know that The Carl is a fan of the snow, but not when I have to start my car at 3:15am (but I get the auto start this week).  But just before I left for work, I cursed out mother nature. At the time is seemed to be a good idea. But the combination of the mountains of Manville and the vengeance we all know Ma Nature has against me, proved a lesson.

      Think about it...what do we see in their commercials? We see a flying Happy Face changing the prices with people just smiling and laughing at their good buddy. Well I don't know what freaky land you live in, but I don't ever see a flying happy face around the store rolling back the prices....and what the hell....I WOULDN'T SMILE. I would be running out of the store screaming like a little sally baby. Who the HELL finds this thing normal?

      Just because you come to TRoTC doesn't mean you are always going to find a The Carl Rant or one of the true stories to his greatness. There are even current events I could tell you about (such as my ex, Britney, gettin hitched). But I will not. Nope...This time around I am going to do something that will shock even the biggest of The Carl fans. This time I am going to let the whole world (because that IS my audience) see the woman I love. And NO...You are not going to see a picture of me and the Twins or even me and Paris...You are going to see the REAL woman who tolerates my insanity and even gives me my meds. Even gives me my meds. Even gives me my meds. Even...oh....I said that. Anyway.....Ladies and gentlemen..... and kids in Li'l John's School (YES I AM HIS UNCLE, AND HE CAN SELL YOU MY AUTOGRAPH)........ Here is the woman I love.....      Danielle.

      Recently there has been a sad and lonely 28 year old loser who lives with is daddy and mommy leaving hate filled messages on the Rants of The Carl. Now we know none of us really are affected by what this future multi-cat owner says, but we still felt that you should all see what he looks like. Now we could not obtain any photographic evidence to the fact that his 'area' can be compared to a planters peanut, although we know the picture exists, but instead, we here at The Rants of The Carl felt you should all see what this sad soul looks like...

      Well, as many of you know, The Carl has finally broken off his relationships with The O Twins, Brit, and JLo and has made the dive into settling down with his #1 woman. He took her down to Walt Disney World and asked for her hand in front of Cinderella's Castle. After Danielle told him yes, he bought the Castle from Cinderella and kicked everyone out.  But before the closing, A woman, who was in tears, approached The Carl (and the future Mrs The Carl) and told them how beautiful it was, and insisted on taking a picture of them so that they could have that day remembered forever. And since she was so taken by what The Carl had just done (and the fact that it was his camera) he didn't even charge her to take his picture (with the future Mrs The Carl). And though it scanned in poorly, is still the best picture of the lot.  Thank You stranger crying lady...you truely are a fan of The Carl.  Are those tears???

      Theorizing that one could time travel within his own lifetime, The Carl stepped into the Quantum Leap accelerator and vanished .... He woke to find himself trapped in his own body but with his 1985 face and teeth and driven by an unknown force to change history for the better. His only guide on this journey is Travis, a The Carl Fan from his own time, who appears in the form of Betty Boop that only The Carl can see and hear. And so The Carl finds himself leaping from hairstyle to hairstyle, striving to put right what once went wrong and hoping each time that his next leap will be the leap to stop the rein of The Home Depot.

      After The Carl beat Ashton (who sadly calls himself "The Ash" to be like our beloved, T.C.), they went out for their Tacos.  Then, after The Carl drank Amstel Light (The brewery, not the beer itself), He gave a FULLY dressed Ashton a bath! Man he was drunk!

      As a fan of SciFi Channels   urlLink Mad Mad House  , I had to stop by the Alt's house while I was on tour with Aerosmith. After performing for the remaining guests/contestants, I hung out with Art, the Modern Primative, and got some great advice on the two new tattoos I designed. He was full of great advice; Including "Do not wear your hair in dreads." He was right!

      Many of you have been wondering where The Carl has gone. Well.... His dream finally came true: He toured with AEROSMITH. Little did TC and the band know, but they were equally big fans of each other. "Meeting him was one thing, but rocking it with him on stage was crrrrraaaaaaazzzzzyyyyyyyy" said an excited Steven Tyler.  After the opening show, TC and the band were seen at some NYC clubs. "No one knows how to party like them" said The Carl, "I can't wait to get back [on stage] with them!"

We posted this link some time ago, but The Carl was up late one night thinking about stuff, and while cleaning his computer, he came across this link, and felt we should post it once again.

      THIS JUST IN.... With a single search in his Google Toolbar, The Carl discovered that Duncan is from the UK and has his own blog site. After more careful digging, we also discovered that Duncan went to the same finishing school as his nemesis, Tim-Tom. While at School, Tim-Tom walked in on Duncan having 'relations.' Now this would not seem to bother many people, except in this case, Duncan was not with a woman, but a watermelon with a picture of The Queen taped on it.  Embarrassed by this, Duncan set out to destroy Tim-Tom and his credibility. However, word quickly spread across campus of Duncan's 'Fruitty Good Time' and he was expelled from the School. Still bitter by all of this, Duncan searched for a way to get maximum exposure to spread lies and threats about Tim-Tom. While sitting in a pub in town, Duncan overheard a conversation about a new American sensation that was getting people world wide excited. This sensation... The Rants of The Carl.  So He logged on and quickly saw that TRoTC had a following and thought to himself that it would be a good forum to spread those lies and threats about Tim-Tom. What he didn't realize is that we Americans really don't give a shit.      Poor Duncan.  Let's just pray he doesn't get a watermelon seed stuck in the hole.

      Ok, so Janet shows her boobie to the world.  Take it out on her. The damn government is cracking down way too much. England shows boobs all the time, and their crime rate is lower.  Not only are they trying to get Howard Stern off the air, but now they have attacked The Carl. Don't worry, TROTC fans, they can't get us here because the internet is ungoverned...BUT, they did ban my first runway show from airing on fox this weekend. In it, I show my bosoms. But they said it was to sexual and shut me down. I say we attack back, and march on Washington. Who's with me?

      So after The Carl left the concert, he cut his locks and he and his long-time friend, Superman, headed off to a birthday party. It was a great time. Well, that was until Superman had one too many Krypto-tonics. Knocked him on his ass.  Poor, TC was stuck holding up his cape while Sup' prayed to the toilet. OH, Those two!!!

      Years ago, the Angel Metatron appeared in a ball of fire to The Carl and told him life altering news. The Carl, a Roman Catholic, was actually connected to Jesus.  As it turns out, The Carl is a descendant of young Jesus' neighbor's second cousin's friend.  This was difficult for The Carl at first. But after hitting up a bar with Metatron, he relaxed and listened to the story of Jesus' neighbor's second cousin's friend. It was an amazing story of a man, who at the time heard about the man known through the land as king of the Jews, but never actually met him, nor witnessed his crucifixion, but heard about it from a traveling salesman.  The Carl was so moved by this story, that he has turned it into next summer's sure hit. Though controversial with the Carlics (The Church of Carlism started by his fans), it is sure to win over the hearts of millions.  And with the director being Mel Gibson's brother, it is sure to please.

      June 13th marks one of the most important days in American History...   Not only does The Carl have 5 days until he's 26, and his new movie,  He's All Mine  opens nationwide, but his two beautiful co-stars turn 18! That's right. The newly legal O' Twins finally share the big screen with our own TC.   "He is such an amazing guy," said Mary-Kate, "I just wish he wouldn't make me wait until I'm 18 before going out with me."   The movie is about two sisters who fall in love with the same man. Only at first he doesn't realize that he has been with two different women. And when he finally does, he doesn't mind, but the girls won't share. "I just hope that Ashley and I fighting over him in real life doesn't hurt box office sales." The Carl said, "Mmmmmm. Twins."  OH THAT CARL!!!!

      Ok...An actual rant. I allowed 5 people to go infront of me today. How many of them waved a 'thank you' to me?    NONE! And while I was at work, I had many people approach me and DEMAND assistance.  What has happened to the world that we can't even say "Please" or "Thank you" ... Not to mention the "Excuse me..." There are too many rude ass holes in the world today. And to all of them...

      The Holy Day is upon us. The Day of the Carl, known to Hallmark as "Carl's Birthday" is finally here. For his 26th year, The Carl finally got his tattoos completed and went to the club with his pals, Brad Pitt, Colin Farrell, The Olsen Twins, and Paris Hilton. At his side was his beautiful bride to be, Danielle. The night was a complete hit, that is, up until the Olsen twins picked a fight over The Carl with Danielle. In the end, they all went home with our Favorite "The"

      Because it was such a beautiful wedding, and we didn't get it on tape, I want you to have my toast to you two.   I would like to start this toast off with a story. It was the end of the day of one of my last days in 2nd grade. I was sitting on the bus when a short, skinny kid got on and walked right past me. As he did, he tripped over my foot, landed on his face and went crying to the bus driver. Now I had to spend the last 2 weeks of school sitting at the front of the bus with all the kids that got picked on.  One year later, my friend bob, that skinny kid, and I are playing on a tire swing. That kid bent over to tie his shoe when the tire hit him in the head, then into a pole, and knocked him out. So now after tripping him, and knocking him out, for some reason he is told he can't hang out with me because I am a bad kid. THANK GOD kids don't listen. Since the 3rd grade that skinny kid and I have grown to be the best of friends. Like Brothers.  So on July 4, 2003, when he asked me to be the best man at his wedding, all I can say is... ...Scott, I am glad I tripped you 18 years ago. And Amanda, I know you are the one who will be there to pick him up for the rest of your lives. I know you two were meant to be, and that you will be together forever. Here's to a long and healthy life together.

      A man once known as  Mail Fraud Boy  (Long story of his crimes of Alfred University)now has a some-what monthly letter that goes out called "Mind Wanderings Uphill Both Ways." In the one sent today, Travis the Graphic Designer(Mail Fraud boy), included an article by  urlLink Dr. Ergun Mehmet Caner . In it, he compares Pres Bush to Pres Lincoln. He talks about how both men, despite its political suicide, did what was right, and stepped forward to help people who had no/little rights and could not help themselves. For those of you who suffer from poor education, let me help... Lincoln freed the slaves, and Bush freed the tortured people of Iraq. After reading the article, I went to Dr. Caner's website, and I found another article.

      In a recent post, we mentioned that The's fiancé, Danielle, was away filming her new show,  Naughty Little French Maid . Well, this new Skin-a-max (Cinemax after hours) show is a big hush hush project. With The Carl's connections, we managed to get an on-set photo from her new project. Just don't go and show everyone...we don't want to get The Carl in trouble!!!

      In recent comments, people have expressed their concerns for Mary-Kate, Ashley, Paris, Nicole, and Danielle.... ...This is both understandable, and appreciated on their behalf.   ...But it is also not necessary. These women, like all harems, understand and LOVE this situation.  What you, The Carl fans need to remember, is that The Carl is The Great White Pizzimp.

      So Fox announced it's plans for The Simple Life 3. They are going to take the Posh Paris and Nicole and have them live with The Carl and act as his wives. Among the normal wife duties such as Dishes, Laundry, and Cleaning, they each must give birth to his children and raise them as stay at home moms. We asked The Carl his thoughts, but all he could do was smile!  Danielle could not be reached for comment because she was filming her new show, "Naughty Little French Maid" down in Ocean City. Recently, The Carl was seen with his new co-stars on the streets of Manville. All he could do....        ...Was smile.

      A few years ago, many of you enjoyed the sequel to Mission: Impossible. But what many of you don't know is that The Carl was the original lead actor in that film. And like Erik Stoltz being replaced by a shorter, Michael J Fox in Back to the Future, The Carl was pretty pissed being replaced by a MUCH shorter, Thomas Cruise Mapother IV. The kid who wanted to be a priest STOLE that role from The Carl. So much for Thou Shalt Not Steal. Bastard.  Anyway, recently, the original shot of MI:2 starring, The Carl hit the internet. And we here at TRoTC found the original movie poster.   LONG LIVE THE CARL.
