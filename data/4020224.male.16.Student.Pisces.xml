       Whats up blog? Today stayed back for chemistry test and physics practical. Wanted to say sorry to (1) cause I asked me whether there is a test today or not. I said no, but then fat bastard Mr. lee say got test. K la “sorry for saying today no test K?” after physics practical some people were planning to play pool. Wanted to follow but..(adela) then ask a friend called weixian what time self study finish then he said “330 la” with low voice HAHAHA. There a friend called Fauzi, he pulled (1) s hair. I knew he was just playing but then, why he dare to pull someone’s hair.. It’s disrespectful. Like chui say “incorrigible”. I think I wont go steady with (2) so boring..la. Everyday thinking of (1), plain tired of that but just cant stop myself from thinking of perfect HER. Done nothing much to say already la.

       Whats up…today I stayed back in school thinking I would go home with (2). Actually I stayed back in school to do my design n technology artifact. I think I will not go steady with (2) la. Cause look at the time. A few weeks more and the pre prelim will start. If I go steady with (2) it would be distracting RIGHT? So, I’ll wait till after ‘O’s maybe I start flirting to (1) only then. And I’ll repeat maybe k? Respect is something I have for everyone. Its just the amount of respect is different. Can’t wait for prom. For the people whose thinking of something bad…haha ish ish ish wats up man. I have great amount of respect for (1) k? So don’t you bull shit. That’s all for today blog blog blog wats up man  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

       I've been thinking bout what (1) said to me..She sounds right..never seen (2) going steady with someone for a long period of time. One example is Radzi(my friend)&nbsp;he got steady&nbsp;with (2) only for about two&nbsp;weeks. (1) is the only girl i thought of living my whole life with. Imagine--

        Few days ago i started to talk to a gerl name _ _ _ _(2). Nothing much happened. Last month i ask her whether she had a stead... she said she got one.. today i ask her, what his&nbsp;name was. She said currently she does not have one..(she broke up lah) that nevermind lah.. At night(juz now) i told another girl called _ _ _ _ _ _(1). I&nbsp; requested (1) for five words that fits&nbsp;(2).She said she cant think of any word.(1)asked me why i asked bout (2). I said i wanted to go steady wif (2). (1) asked, why i chose (2) when there are better gals out thera.&nbsp;I replied "what better gals, U" she replied no la.."....i kinda noe how she lyk ok...tak takot ditipu ke?" ... her last message for the day was for me to take care and be careful it could be painful.. Then (2) sms me giving me a goodnight paragraph saying:     &nbsp;   Mengundur Daku Ke Alam mimpi,    Dgn izin tuhan akanku kembali.    jika pergi dan tiada kembali,    ku pohon doa keikhlasan di hati...    selamat malam buatmu sahabatku
