       yesterday i did something odd. i decided to trust the universe (just a little bit), so i put my bank details on this blog for 10 minutes. it was quite thrilling. if my account had been drained, i could only blame myself. i could only laugh at my stupidity. at least it wouldn't kill me. i have no idea how much of a risk i took but i have survived! thank you universe for not getting me. yet!

       the clouds are having a long, hard mutter on us and it doesn't look like its going to stop for a while. english weather is weird! last night i tried to go to grantham to practice driving for my test. ironically i only got as far as dry doddington. it was torrential and my windows steamed up so i couldn't see. poor me, are there higher forces trying to stop me driving in grantham? last week when i tried to go i had a puncture. when i eventually got back to newark, beaconhill road had become a river. as i ploughed into the deepest part of the road the door of a parked car to my left opened and a lady waded out. there was nothing i could do to stop my tidal wave utterly drenching her. i looked back and it was the sunday school teacher of the local evangelical church. when i was an innocent defenceless child i attended the sunday school for a while and she told us all lots of ridiculous happy clappy nonsense about the holy superstar saviour of mankind. i must admit it was a delight to see her soaked. shit, i hope i don't go to hell. it was an accident! ;)   its still raining buckets.
