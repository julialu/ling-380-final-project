      WoW, today was the only day in the summer that I woke up early. Hehes. I woke up at 8:30 am `cause of Tommy and Jenny. Hahas. Jenny kept disturbing me and Tommy kept jumping on me. Hahas. Couldn't sleep so I woke up. Hahas.  So funny last night, when Jenny and I were talking to my Fagtard, a.k.a Vanny Dang. Hahas. =] Jenny was like so hyper and she was acting all stupid and kidish, even though she's like 8, but oh wells, same thing. Hahas. She kept laughing and then when she would, she would fall off her chair. Hahas. Lmao. =] She's like, "Jimmy go byebye, and I go hihi." Hahas. Lmao.  Then it was beddy bye time! Hahas. =] Jenny slept with me! Hahas. So fun, we kept whispering, but I guess our whispering was too loud, `cause my mom kept telling us to go to sleep. Hahas. But we kept talking until I was like really tired and I kept telling Jenny to go to sleep, but Jenny was not sleepy, so she kept bothering me when I was trying to sleep.

       Laa-Dee-Daa, so bored right nows, since Jimmy went home. =( I miss him already, even though he's just going back to Hamilton. I can't believe me and my brother, Tommy, cried when he went home. Hahas. But I'm okay, I'm all calm now. LoLs. =] So sad though. He stayed down here since summer `04 started, and today, he went home. We had so much great memories when he was down here, in Guelph. =]   There was this day when it was so boring at home, that Jimmy, Denny, and I decided to The Galaxy to watch a movie. We were gonna watch The White Chicks, but then I wanted to watch The Notebook so, I got it my way. Hahas. =P Lmao, in the theatres, it was soo hilarious `cause Jimmy, Denny, and I sat at the very top seats, and then when the movie started, Jimmy, Denny, and I took our shoes off and rested our legs on the seats infront of us. Hahas. And then, we scared this lady infront of us with our stinky feets I guess, so she moved all the way down to the very bottom. Hahas. Lmao. =] We so special! =] Hmmm, then Jimmy was done eating his Nachos, he threw it on the seat everywhere. Hahas. And then, when the movie got to a touching part, Denny and Jimmy were fake crying and it was soo hilarious. Hahas. Butt then the movie caught mine and Jimmy's attention so we watched it and then Denny was so bored and he didn't even like the movie and he kept disturbing us so we yelled at him. Hahas. =]   Then this other day, when A Cinderella Story came out, Jimmy and I decided to go and watch it, so we invited Denny along. We were suppose to invite Jenny toos, but me and Jimmy forgot. Hahas. Wee soo badd! Hahas. A Cinderella Story was good! Hahas. I loved it! LoLs. But Denny actually shutted up this time. Hahas. I guessed he liked it toos. Lmao. =]  Lmao, I can't forget when I went to the movie theatres with Jimmy and Jenny to watch A Princess Diaries 2: The Royal Engagement. Hahas. It was such a good movie. Hahas. Lmao, then in the middle of the movie, Jenny was about to get up but then she fell to the ground and bumped her head onto the seat. hahas. Everyone started looking at us because we were laughing our heads off. hahas. =]] It was soo muchh funn. LoLs. =]  Jimmy, Denny, and I would usually walk to Willow West Mall like every week or so. Hahas. We'd like fool around everywhere. Hahas. And this one time, Jimmy, Denny, Jenny, and I, we were sitting on those sample swinging chairs and then, we got kicked out of Zellers because of some old lady who works there. Hahas. She's like, "Ohh, where are your parents kids? You shouldn't be running around everywhere." Blahh Blahh Blahh and started saying these shiets. Hahas. Suchh a fag. LoLs. =]  Laa-Dee-Daa, so tired like shiet. Hahas. Good thing Jenny's over with me. =] Hahas. Well that's it. I'm outtie. =]
