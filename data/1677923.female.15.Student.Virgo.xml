      So I got a message from Ashley last night about the whole situation with me and Andrew.     From: ash ley   Sent: Thursday, July 22, 2004 12:06 AM To: *****************@hotmail.com Subject: RE: arrg   Tammi.  To tell you the truth, I dont think you and Andrew will ever be friends again. Things change, sometimes for the worst. You will get new friends and move on. Maybe 5 years down the road you will see him and he will wave. But thats probably as close as you guys will get.  Dont get mad at me but this is life sweetheart, take it or crumble it in your pocket, shit's gonna happen. I wish I knew what Cody meant, too, when he told me that you need to stop what you're doing. Think about everything you've done. That's as much as I can give you.  I have noticed before you have used people. You dont ask; You hang on....EVERY GUY-- That's not  flirting . Thats not a  habit . Thats just rude. And I guess everyone saw that. But sometimes you tend to ignore people when they warn you (hint, hint). Lol. Just work on those and stop talking to Andrew.   .•´  •´¨)    ¸.•¨) (¸.•´    (¸.•´ .•´                    ( ¸.´¯`-
