      so on another note DO NOT STEAL SHOES FROM BOWLING ALLEYS!!!  You will be hit with a truckload of bad karma, and by bad karma I mean your closet will smell terrible.  I can barely open it to get my sweater.  yech!!

      So today I spent 8 hours practicing being a suburban mom... err... what I meant to say is I was babysitting.  Well, by babysitting I mean I was sitting on the designer couch reading "Little New York Bastard".  It's not like I'm lazy or anything, I just didn't want to follow the kids around all creepy-like while they did their own things.  Speaking of creepy, thier house kinda gave me the willies.  It was so immaculately clean and potterybarnesque, I didn't want to touch anything.  It was creepy.

      so i have decided that perhaps instead of this being some way for my to express myself using big words and funny anecdotes it would be more useful as a picture display thingy.  Oh come one, lets be honest, anyone whom im friends with has an attention span the length of my... well, lets just say it's short, and besides all anyone ever does is just skim for their names or for juicy details.  So here are the grad night photos.

       urlLink    So guess who I ran into on tuesday???  Yeah thats right good ole Billy Boy.  That also happened to be the first night I have ever spent the night on a sidewalk.  Urban camping?  No, we were goin to the book signing.  So Blakely, Dan, and I left her house at midnight to camp out the meet Clinton.  So 16 hours later we didn't get him to sign our books but we were photographed by 4 newspapers and filmed by 2 newsguys.  We were on fire.  But as he was leaving the building I saw his hair and even his face for a good 2 seconds.  I mean I looked into the eyes of Bill Clinton!!!! (GASP). All and all not bad.&nbsp; urlLink

      So I just got back from adventuring in Costa Rica.  It pretty cool.  The best part was the petting of the giant wild 3 twoed sloth which I was engaging in.  I had a cool pic but it got lost somehow, maybe later.....
