         3.08am  I realise that sitting here for the time I have is not a good thing   Not socialising with anybody while listening to the same music over and over can make one insane   Needing to say something to somebody but not being able to put it into words, for you already have explained it to them and for them to disagree, is not a nice feeling   There is a blind spot in my head, a bullet-shaped hole where the answers should be. Call it denial   One Day A Lemming Will Fly, One Day They Will Realise, One Day Destinies Will Collide, On That Day She Will Realise   The past is a puzzle,  Like a broken mirror,  As you piece it together, You cut yourself. Your image keeps shifting, and you change with it.It could destroy you,drive you mad.It could set you free.

      The 6 weeks or whatever nowadays holiday is a long and boring and crap time, where nothing happens &nbsp; Soon I will go insane and stay up until 6am every night/morning then wake up at either 12pm or 6pm &nbsp; DEATH &nbsp; Yeh..so... &nbsp; Today wasn't really thrilling, some people came round who I know and we played Vice City and Max Payne 2 all day, but considering that I've played them two SO much that it hurts, I wasn't really happy &nbsp; Anyway, I have to go move guitars now
