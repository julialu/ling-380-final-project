       "Goodbye PC" Of all the things I've seen in I just want to get it over with Thoughts form inside my mind But I do not try Counting the days that pass me by  I've been searching deep down in my books Things&nbsp;that I'm seeing are starting to get bold It feels like I'm starting all over again The last three days were just pretend And I said,   [Chorus:] Goodbye pc Goodbye to pc in&nbsp;everything that I knew You know i always try The one thing that I always believe in The one thing that I always believe in   I still get lost in your eyes And it seems that I can't live a day without you Closing my eyes and you chase my thoughts away To a place where I am blinded by the light But it's not right   [Chorus] And its hurtless to want everything and nothing at the same time I want what's inside and I want what's mine I want you But you're not giving in this time   [Chorus x2] And when the&nbsp;work begins I'll stay&nbsp;blank at the screen you're getting a restart

       Was at the In service the whole afternoon. It was a good tour as we went to the heritage center there to recap the history of the force. Saw many things there which i think is a good thing that trainees should have the opportunity to go too. but as for my time i do not have that kind of chance to go there&nbsp;.&nbsp; During the trip the whole display was good but somehow still left out somethings that the force should have put in. like the old OPS room machines that they use can still put it into the heritage to signify the growth. when i first go to the air force center there were lots more things to see so the force should also take the steps to improve the displays.

       UWF AGM an annual meeting for the department. This yr was totally a mess only a few of them turn up for it and the rest was like Huh! kind of attitude. Still miss my first AGM it was like so fun everyone was there and everyone was sabotaging each other to become the next welfare officers.   When running, clock 32:48 still bad from my last one clock 32:42. I think I'm getting old. Think still needs to improve on the curve running&nbsp; skill as i always slow down at the curve up the hill.  Updating my PDA and reading some news on the net. Tmr will be a short day i hope.   &nbsp;

       yah i got a shock. i met my old sec friend while on my way back home. Yes, it was a surprise for me but theres one thing that trouble me. He told me that one of our friend met an accident and had to amputat one leg due to the the serious hitting on his knee cap. My friend told me that in the first place that he intended to keep it but wasn't able to or he cannot choose to as his leg was bleeding profusely from the wound. In the end he chose to had his leg amputated.   When i heard it i was like so shock that i think i stunned and my friend was like am i ok ? i was ok but i felt a sudden sadness that came from the bottom of my heart. i asked "Why is this&nbsp;happening to my friend?" He signed on as a regular and had great future. Why did he deserves this fate? With all this happening to him, i don't know he can take it and carry on with his life.   I hope he can get well soon get better with life. i know that he will never get over it. Will one get over it? No! yes, its a straight no! no one can get over it. even i can't get over the matter myself.   What is happening? Just this month one of our mdm's mum departed and just today i recieved news from my friend that his grandpa has gone. just one month i recieve so many sad news.   人生最大的悲哀，是自己對前途沒有希望；  人生最壞的習慣，是自己對工作沒有計劃。

         七里香          曲：周傑倫    詞：方文山    編：鐘興民         窗外的麻雀 在電線桿上多嘴  你說這一句 很有夏天的感覺  手中的鉛筆 在紙上來來回回  我用幾行字形容你是我的誰    秋刀魚 的滋味 貓跟你都想瞭解  初戀的香味就這樣被我們尋回  那溫暖 的陽光 像剛摘的鮮艷草莓  你說你捨不得吃掉這一種感覺    雨下整夜 我的愛溢出就像雨水  院子落葉 跟我的思念厚厚一迭  幾句是非 也無法將我的熱情冷卻  你出現在我詩的每一頁    雨下整夜 我的愛溢出就像雨水    我接著寫 把永遠愛你寫進詩的結尾  你是我唯一想要的瞭解    那飽滿 的稻穗 幸福了這個季節  而你的臉頰像田裡熟透的蕃茄  你突然 對我說 七里香的名字很美  我此刻卻只想親吻你倔強的嘴    雨下整夜 我的愛溢出就像雨水  院子落葉 跟我的思念厚厚一疊  幾句是非 也無法將我的熱情冷卻  你出現在我詩的每一頁 整夜    我的愛溢出就像雨水 窗台蝴蝶  像詩裡紛飛的美麗章節 我接著寫  把永遠愛你寫進詩的結尾 你是我唯一想要的瞭解

       someone got pissed . yah someone  somehow it was words that cause these things to happen.  yes it is.  i believe it will be over soon but still memories of the unhappiness will stay intact.  To forget or remember.  I was reading this manga xXx HoLic from CLAMP one of the famous comic publisher. The recent one xXx 4 was on something abt words. It says that words is one of the element that can bined one person to another. Its a snow ball effect if it was not handle properly.  i mean it was not the first time but i think they gone too far. But somehow or rather it still needs 2 hands to clap. there must have always a cause and effect.  i'm not saying that i'm a great person but experience tell me that to access the situation is to stay quiet and it will be the best way. it doesn't mean that i admitted the things other says but i have a clear conscience.  if get angry over the words they says then congrate they won! yes, by making you angry.  sometimes i do agree that i been harsh too but i think i'm frustrated somehow.  你随时要认命，因为你是人。
