      As you  may  have noticed I've been putting down:  CURRENT MUZIC: ________  This only means what music i'm listening to at the moment. I usually play music to clear my thoughts and it helps me get in the mood for anything really. I could listen to Utada Hikaru before a date, or NOFX or the Pillows before going to hang with friends, or even some Classical to liven thigns up before going to a B'nai Mitzvah! Hell, music is great for anything and everything, people please, listen to MORE music and give a thought to something besides Linkin Park, ok? Thanks, I kneeeeww you'd understand.

      today i'll tell you guys about something called school. Mine is a big hulking structure of plaster and metal, Tehiyah Day School. It's a Jewish school, and with this comes good things AND bad things. I've listed these for you in a handy pack:  GOOD POINT:You can get away with crazy shit and no one does anything.  BAD POINT:You can't do anything normal or you will be punished.  GOOD POINT:The kids are nice and sheltered.  BAD POINT:The kids are all white and sheltered.  GOOD POINT:All meals are healthy and vegetarian.  BAD POINT:No MEAT in school meals.  GOOD POINT:No extra classes.  BAD POINT:No extra classes.  as you can see, my school is a piece of crud, thanks for reading folks!   CURRENT MUZIC: Gary Newman-Cars

      Today sucked ass. Period. I have nuthing else to say about this horrid day. But as you might now, I always do so everyone might want to skip all this and just read from the text BELOW:  Jus' got BAM4 for my PSone and it's slammin. With it's vibrant colors and cute characters it's one of the many great games for the orignal PS. IF any of you are not familiar with the Bust-A-Move series you should run out to your local game store and pick it up, because folks, you won't be dissapointed. Before it became a sensation on the PlayStation consoles it was hailed through SNK's handheld system NEO-GEO, named of course, Bubble Bobble. What was two little dinos is now a vast world filled with +9 characters, a chain reaction system and 640 crazy levels of gameplay. I honestly hope more games like this will follow, because this is one GREAT video game.  Also, you should know that I should be gearing towards writing new scripts for my children's book(if i can ever finsih drawing and painting!) and painting the drawings. I'll post more details along the way and you can always e-mail me for more info at: pizzachimp@comcast.net

        Saw  Harold and Kumar go to White Castle  twice already, it was farily good. I thought I might as well tell you guys without spoiling anything. Favorite scenes: racoon in car=HALARIOUS and Extreme Mix 30,000, go see the movie. Although, be prepared to go out to buy fast food burgers after that, cause' half of it's like a WhiteCastle Burger commercial. Yeeeeeah, writing this up in the mountains, i'm tired from playing GT1 sorry fpr the short post, really, i'm sorry...oh yeah here's the [secret project] I told you about:    METALHEADS, square headed robots with antennes, get used to it.      as always,   Henry         CURRENT MUZIC:   N/A

       Not much happened today, sat around and played with the cell-phone and drew a bit. Didn't get much sleep last night so i'm crapped out in the head. Sadly, i'm leaving tommarow for a bit, be back soon-a, been working on MARIO, beaten it once, trying to beat the extra version, HARRRRRD-D-D-D-D-D. So yeah, just wanted to update you guys before I left.         Also, John Kerry's been doing well in the polls, and Bush, while spending millions on campaign ads to make fun of Kerry, still hasn't been very good umongst the americans. we'll all see what happens, although my hopes are still high...Put up John and John stuff in the window.

       new style of font, get used to it please, cause it's staying for the rest of this blog. So yeah, just got back from a 2-week vacay in Georgia, it was good, hot and humid was bad *wheeze wheeze* but had a bike so all waz well. Been putting off drawing for awhile, but HAVE been catching up on reading RED DRAGON, halfway thru it....errr, yeah I didn't really have much to write. I need ideas, summer is always hard to draw in because school is so boring, it's hte only thing TO do. Let's see, [secretproject] coming up soon, i'll update you guys sometime later. Horishigami was a good game, confusing but good. OH! Been playing Gran Turismo1, it's been very fun. Been racing a converted rally edition RX-7 A-SPEC and a incredibly modded Imperza rally edition. If anyone has any advice or good ideas on the game email or IM me please. So...payce!!         as always,   Henry         CURRENT MUZIC:   M.O.P.-Ante Up
