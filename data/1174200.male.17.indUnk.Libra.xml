      Tuesday, October 28, 2003  So...Andrew did something like this and it was a great, uplifting post. So I figured I'd do it as well...just so I can express my true feelings since nobody will ever read this unless I want them to:   Where to start. I'm so thankful for my friends and what they have taught me and given me in the past few years. Elizabeth, I've known you the longest and I know that you are hysterical, smart, funny, wise...just a little bit of everything. When I'm with you I feel I can be myself, and I like that. Heidi, you, above anybody else, are the friend I respect the most. Like...I'm really not lying. You want to learn and aren't afraid to show it and even though I may have once gotten mad at you for it, I still respect that in you. You are so smart and I think that you will go places after high school...not to sound cliched. Jana, I know I may have offended you, but I truly do value your friendship. It's fun to laugh with you at really stupid things and to hear you lament about your life. You have a great sense of humor and a no-bullshit attitude. Diana...what can I say? I know we don't talk that much but you are quite possibly the most unique person I've ever met. I love your duct tape satchel. I love your constant way of making everything seem funny. Theo, you may annoy me sometimes, but I can still always joke with you and to have you not take it personally is great. You are so smart and from first glance, not everybody can see that. You know you're a bit different but that doesn't stop you from doing things that may annoy others, and it makes people laugh. People can laugh at you and you'll never be offended. Caroline, you can act better than anybody I know. You were so good as Lady Macbeth and you are so funny. You're like a female me. Mike, your sense of humor is always welcome. Nothing is serious, everything is a joke and sometimes that's the way it needs to be. Landon, as much as I abuse you and hurt you and call you names, you make me laugh and I had the most fun with you at rehearsal more than anybody. Meghan, I told you to break up with Alex and you did. Finally. It's about time. You are very unique and a free spirit who is unabashedly going to do what they want. John, you may piss me off sometimes, but I'll always respect your opinions and views and your quick wit. Katie, I haven't talked to you much this year, but it's always great to hear the contempt in your voice for the powers that be because it's true. Reuben, I may have strongly disliked you prior to this year, but I've really gotten to know you a lot better this year and even though I may want to scream whenever you start talking about politics, it is fascniating. Joshlyn, keep playing tuba and whatever else you want to play...and keep wearing those short skirts! Rachel, I love your laugh. I love how you can be this funny, crazy girl and then get down to work whenever there is work that needs to be done. It's helped so much with Yearbook this past week. Simon, you are so smart and I hate that you have these insecurities because it isn't true. You are smart, you are valued by your friends and that's something to keep near to your heart. Charlotte, you are one funny person who knows what to say and when to say it without offending anybody. Alex Kovach, I just got to know you, but you have a strange way of showing your appreciation for things...and that makes it funnier. Brittany, I hope you're taking school seriously and not skipping because you are beautiful and funny and it would be a shame for you to lose that. I've known you longer than everybody at Northwest save Andrew and Elizabeth, and I value your friendship immensley. Jennifer, so I may have gotten mad at you, but I'm glad you knew when it was best to stop talking about it and I'm glad that we both knew when to stop. I loved the IM conversation we had and I'm glad I can refer to you as my friend. Robin, you are blonde. And smart. And quirky. And I love that. Daleelah, I admire the fact that you brought up an opinion that was obviously not going to be agreed with in English AP and you defended it to the best of your ability which was a very good thing as you were very convincing. I'm glad I'm getting to know you. Kate, my costume sucked! No, just keep up your smiles and laughter and jokes and you'll be fine. Lily, you also can act better than a lot of people, both theatre wise and maturity wise. I respect that. Amanda, I haven't gotten to talk to you much this year, but you are one funny girl and sometimes I remember from you that not everything should be taken seriously. Delaney, I called you insane, I called you crazy, and I've been annoyed, but you knew what you were doing and even if I didn't agree with it half the time, you still won't be afraid to insert as much sex as possible. To both Bens, Harter and McCarthy, one of you is just weird, but in a good way, and the other was just fun to talk to at rehearsal because you really are a smart and funny person. Whiteside, I LOVE YOUR CLASS! I look foward to it everyday. You teach us something you have an obvious passion for and even if we have a ton of work, we still love it because we want to do it and we want to learn. Joyce, hey, I may not love your class, but it's nice to have a teacher who doesn't take themselves seriously and can insult a student as much as they want to. Mitchell, don't ever change. Keep throwing things at students. Please. Stay short and gray. I loved Theatre III and that's mainly because you were the teacher. Mrs. Monjimbo, the way you can be so motherly, as if you were a mother encouraging their child to do well in school was a great thing to have first thing in the morning. Courtney, you were the valedictorian. What more needs to be said? You were fun to talk to in the morning and I miss you and wish I could have that class with the same students again. Ms. Ridenour, sometimes you can be a bitch, but in a good way. You've always had more of a friend-friend relationship with me than a teacher-student friendship and I like that I have a teacher who I can do that with. Dillard, you might be the smartest person I know, and I love your insults you hurl at students left and right and I love how you understand that the students in your class can be frustrated by the material but still want to learn it and are doing their best to learn the material. Ayana, you are so beautiful and so talented and I can't wait for you to make it to Broadway and to hopefully invite me to whatever award shows you may attend, whether it be the Oscars or Tonys.   And thus...we come to the last two people I have yet to mention. Jesse and Andrew. I've been through hell and back with you, Jesse, and we both have our separate issues to work out about our friendship but you are funny, intelligent, sarcastic, not fake...frankly, everything about you is perfect. I know we've been through some shit lately, but we managed to make it through. You are perfect in every respect. You are smart, you know that you should enjoy life, not hate it, and you have guts like no one else. I would have never been able to do what you did to me during rehearsal that fateful day. Ever. I'm not that brave. But you...you are just a perfect example of a girl. You are everything to me, and quite possibly by best female friend.   I recognized so much of myself in you lately that I just kind of made that inference about what was happening. I'm glad, Andrew, that you are somebody I can be honest with. I'm glad that we're dating. I've never felt more...like myself than when I've been with you these past few weeks. We both are awkward around each other but I think that's because we both don't want to screw anything up. Thanks for being able to listen to me and I'm glad you were that open with me, otherwise, it would have been strange conversation. I hate that your parents and brother are like that because it's stopping you from being yourself around them. Maybe someday you can tell them. I hope that someday that will happen for you. You are one of my funniest friends and I would never want to lost you as a friend.  posted by Nick @ Tuesday, October 28, 2003  Sunday, October 26, 2003  As long as you want to believe in something...you will. Wanting to believe is half the battle. It may not be God, at least not the God your used to, it could be another religion entirely. Tree-spirits and druidism, for all you know....but it'll be something   -Jesse  posted by Nick @ Sunday, October 26, 2003  I...hmm...I don't know what to post. I had another date with Andrew. We kind of just sat and talked, but without as many awkward silences as last time. He walked me to my car, which was sweet, but then I didn't know if I should hug him or kiss him or what...we're both afraid of screwing something up...he told me, and I know I definitely am...I don't know. I really like him and don't want anything bad to happen  posted by Nick @ Sunday, October 26, 2003  Friday, October 24, 2003  So...the date with Andrew went well. We were both nervous, I think that was obvious, but we...it's mostly filler until the end. When he hugged me and I nearly started jumping up down with glee and joy. I've been so happy since I got home. Rupert almost got voted off Survivor, but I don't think even that would have dampened my mood. He instigated a hug! And I seriously tried to see if I could still have his smell on my clothes later.   If we ever kiss, I may melt on contact  posted by Nick @ Friday, October 24, 2003  Thursday, October 23, 2003  I have a date with Andrew in a couple of hours.   I'm really getting kind of nervous. I've been on dates before, but never with somebody who I know really likes me and I really like them. And it's Andrew. I'm just really kind of...giddy, i guess.  posted by Nick @ Thursday, October 23, 2003  Tuesday, October 21, 2003  I think this address is working again (if not, I'll find out in a minute.)  Um, Intolerable Cruelty sounds good to me. It'd probably be better if we went to see one of the earlier shows, since I . . . no wait, I actually might . . . oh, but you won't, okay scratch that whole sentece. I guess the five o'clock show would probably be best, unless you wanted to go earlier . . . or later, it doesn't really matter.  Yeah, it does seem kind of strange doesn't it. I guess the whole dating process is truly something new to me (since those middle school relationships didn't really mean anything,) and then there's the fact that I'm dating a guy, and then that I'm dating one of my friends . . . it's just a lot I think, but it's also very nice. Alright . . . I don't remember what the other thing was that I was going to say, I don't think it was important. Bye.  - Andrew  posted by Nick @ Tuesday, October 21, 2003  I find it kind of odd/ironic/funny/sweet how the past two days at school, mine and Andrew's cars have been parked side by side  posted by Nick @ Tuesday, October 21, 2003  Sunday, October 19, 2003  Ha ha ha. Oh, I had fun...well...I had an interesting time with Andrew at Birkdale. Turns out we both wanted to meet somewhere to tell each other we had a crush on each other.   Oh, I laugh.   In any case, we then just talked about life and school and stuff...and it eventually changed into an interesting topic about three hours after we met. Herewith, the conversation to the best of my memory:   Me: Okay, hypothetically, we both have a crush on each other...if I was to ask you about dating...what would you say?  Andrew: (Laughing) What?  Me: (Laughing) I can't believe I just said that  Andrew: I can't either  Me: This is entirely hypothetical. I'm not suggesting anything.  Andrew: Hypothetically, would you ask if you had the time?  Me: I was lying about that between me and Jessie. I'll have time after Macbeth is over. I just made that the big reason, with was a lie.  Andrew: Okay  Me: (Pause) There's a lot of hypotheticalness here  Andrew: Yeah  Me: (Pause)  Andrew: (Pause)  Me: (Pause)  Andrew: Would you ask me if you knew I'd say yes?  Me: Would you?  Andrew: (Without skipping a beat, I swear) Yes  Me: (Long pause here) Well...why not?  Andrew: Sure  Me: Well...  Andrew: So that only took three hours  Me: Yeah  Andrew: (Chuckle)  Me: So we're dating  Andrew: Yep   And that is the extent. I'm kind of surprised. In any case...I have a boyfriend. God that's weird to type. But I do. We're going to do something this weekend. Geez...this has been weird  posted by Nick @ Sunday, October 19, 2003  Saturday, October 18, 2003  So I had a dream last night. It was really nice, but also kind of weird. So, anyways, it's the usual group of friends at some really big auditorium in a school in our school system, and we happen to be there for some reason. In any case, I'm talking to Andrew, and suddenly, he does exactly what Jesse did and grabs my shoulders and pulls my mouth towards his and kisses me. And I kiss back. And we kiss some more.   Then I go off to his house with him for some strange reason and I don't really remember what I did there. Other then that his room was full of videotapes.   Andrew and I are supposed to meet somewhere either today or tomorrow. After that dream, I'd prefer tomorrow.  posted by Nick @ Saturday, October 18, 2003  Wednesday, October 15, 2003  I want to cry so badly right now. I want to talk to Andrew about this without e-mails, but can't, and it's slowly killing me. There's so much I know we both want to say to each other about this, but we're both so busy we haven't found any time whatsoever.   FUCK! DAMN!   I have this huge crush on Andrew and I can't tell him. And he's starting to act very silent and subdued again and I can't talk to him. And all of this is slowly making me very irritable and I'm just ready to break down.   I don't regret telling Andrew, I'd never regret that because I think it needed to be done. However, since I told him, it seems like we've become more distant. I haven't been able to look him in the eye, much less talk to him about anything.   I really want us to go somewhere this weekend or next week and just talk because I think we're both holding stuff back that we can't say over this system called e-mail.   I'm so depressed and I'm tired and I'm lonely and I'm sad. I think I'll go cry  posted by Nick @ Wednesday, October 15, 2003  Saturday, October 11, 2003  This whole Blog is an event transpired between myself and Andrew, and is still currently transpiring.   The reason I want to keep this as a record of what's happened is because...well...that's hard to explain. How about I've been in the exact same positin Andrew has been in. I used almost the exact same phrasing as Andrew did when he told me he was gay as when I told Emily I was bi. I swear to god, the fact that he was gay didn't nearly surprise me as much as how closely the two letters were worded.   I kind of figured out Andrew was gay. I mean, he's not some flamboyantly gay guy, but I just kind of...knew.   He's very funny, very enthusiastic about most stuff, and this school year he became very serious and contemplative...much like me.   I had all ready assumed he was gay long before this, but he had said two things previously (In our sophomore year) that made me doubt that: One, he made out with a nameless girl at a party. Two, he would constantly mention how he hated the fact that as soon as Chris said he was bi, Andrew kind of felt like he was hitting on him.   Perhaps you need to know that this is at an Arts school in North Carolina.   Anyways, Andrew has a blog (Which I won't mention) that he seemed to be getting very...depressed in, so I sent him an E-Mail (below) and he responded.   So...more later  posted by Nick @ Saturday, October 11, 2003  Friday, October 10, 2003  I can honestly say I didn't expect that...and that I really didn't expect you to respond. Any time I've ever told anybody that I am completely honest (Which is true) after they get done talking about something bothering them and they can tell me...it's always a response of "No, that's okay," even if it pertains to just problems with grades or something.  I would hope you've read enough of my website to know that I really don't care if you're gay or not and I also hope you would know I won't tell anyone.   So...yeah. That's about it. I can't imagine what something like this must feel like, but...I don't know. I don't really know how to end this E-mail, so I think I'll stop it right here.   -Nick  posted by Nick @ Friday, October 10, 2003  I can't believe I'm actually doing this, it's probably the hardest thing that I've ever had to do. Okay, first off, please don't feel like you have some sort of obligation to respond or to talk about this to me ever. I know what it's like when you're in a situation where someone's told you something and they really want help (not that I'm exactly asking for help, I don't need help, I'm fine . . I think,) but you have no idea what to do or say and you just end up really frustrated. So please don't feel any need to say anything. While, yes, it would be nice to talk to someone about this, I . . . forgot what I was going to say. Okay. Um, another thing, I'd like not to tell anyone, so if you could keep this between us, that'd be great. . . . I don't even know why I'm telling you--I'm sure it's not something you even want to have to think about, so again, please, don't feel any pressure, please, I mean that very sincerely. Okay. Okay, the thing is, about me, is that . . . I seriously cannot believe I'm saying this. I just, okay, I'm being childish. The thing is that I'm gay. Haha, oh, I can't help but laugh. Yeah, it's not funny, I know. So anyways, that's the thing. It's been killing me for awhile now, so, okay, I don't know what else to say. Other than that I hate it, I don't want to be it, and . . . it's just been harder lately--why I'm now actually telling someone--and I just didn't know what to do (trying to be the least melodramatic as possible.) I've thought about coming out, but that's about it, and in all of the senarios, well, it usually ends up bad for me, so I don't think I'll be telling anyone else for awhile. Truthfully, I don't know if I'll ever tell anyone. It just seems like either way I lose. Maybe I'll tell you why some other time (one step at a time, you know,) if you even want to talk about it. And again, if you don't, please, please, PLEASE don't feel like you're obligated or that you owe me anything, you don't, and I'll be fine. And of course, please don't tell anyone, but, I'm sure you wouldn't anyways. I guess I was just feeling like that guy on Spin City (if you've ever seen it) when he know's this secret and he ends up getting hives and nose bleeds and other funny stuff, anyway, he ends up having to tell someone. I think that's just how I've felt, since I cannot get it off of my mind.  Wow. Well, I don't know about you, but I'm rather shocked that I'm sending this, I had thought for a long time that I could have just gotten through life keeping it a secret, but I guess I was wrong, ha. Alright, I don't know what else to say at the moment. Now, if you'll excuse me, I'll be starring at the send button for about the next hour. Man, I don't know why I can't stop laughing. Well . . . have a nice day, later.  - Andrew  ----- Original Message -----  From: Nickmac11@aol.com  To: andy2343@carolina.rr.com  Sent: Tuesday, October 07, 2003 9:44 PM  Subject: Hello    I'd feel like a hypocrite after reading some recent posts on your other website and not sending you some sort of E-Mail after you responded to that emotionally drenched post I did (Which is going in the newspaper...joy) so...I don't know.

Nickmac11 [11:47 PM]: Then I'll be impressed  posted by Nick @ Saturday, November 29, 2003  Friday, November 28, 2003  That survey makes me seem like a stalker. I'm not. I think it's the fact that I'm in a relationship that defies the typical high school relationship. Andrew and I have not had sex, we aren't kissing each other at every second...we merely enjoy each other's company and like to do things together. Both of us would much rather hold the other's hand or put our arm around the other person than the typical stuff.   What I would look for in a partner is in Andrew. And I fear I'll never find that in another guy because...well...just because. That's kind of why I wish we could be together even after high school...but all good things must come to an end...or that, being logical, we may still be dating at the end of senior year, but we'll probably have to go to different colleges...who knows...maybe we'll keep it up.   I just hope that I find somebody else like him...or that I'm always with him.  posted by Nick @ Friday, November 28, 2003  + I am not: An idiot  + I hurt: when i think about my grandfather  + I love: That I'm in a functional relationship with Andrew and that we both enjoy each other's company  + I hate: That we have to hide it  + I fear: Snakes  + I hope: That whoever I end up with is just as good for me as Andrew is...and I almost hope that person is Andrew  + I crave: Good grades  + I regret: Never going to see my grandfather in the hospital  + I cry: At times  + I care: About my friends  + I always: Compare myself to Andrew  + I long: To have a stress free life  + I feel alone: When I think about God  + I listen: To music...mostly Coldplay and Radiohead...right now it's Saves The Day  + I hide: My true feelings for people  + I drive: A car  + I sing: When I need to  + I dance: When no one is looking  + I write: What I'm thinking  + I breathe: Air  + I play: To keep myself happy  + I miss: My grandfather  + I search: For...hmm...  + I learn: Something everyday  + I feel: Hmm...  + I know: That in all logicalness, Andrew and I will have to say goodbye at the end of senior year  + I say: What do I say?  + I succeed: At writing  + I fail: At math  + I dream: And I wish I didn't  + I wonder: If some cosmic being will allow me to be with Andrew for the rest of my life or be with someone like him  + I want: To be in college  + I worry: That after Andrew, I'll still never find somebody who is right for me  + I wish: How radically this answer has changed...two months ago it would have been that Andrew was gay...now it's that we're together for the rest of our lives  + I have: A brain  + I fight: People...I...guess  + I wait: For the inspiration to actually start the MWDS on The Prince  + I need: Some hot chocolate  + I am: Well...what am I?

It's put me in this euphoric state, and I don't know...should something that small and insignificant do that? I mean...damn...I'm just in a permanently good mood. Three quizzes and paper due this week. So what? I have to spend Thanksgiving with my mom's side of the family and they all hate each other now. So what? I'm so unbelievably happy. I just....   Okay, so we spent close to six hours together yesterday. I said I would meet him at Concord Mills at three. So then we walk around, decided to see a movie, browse FYE until the movie starts, and then go to the movie (Runaway Jury). I suck at public displays of affection, so I debated amongst myself whether or not I should put my arm around him or not since he had done that to me at the last movies we had been to. So I just sucked it up and did it. And he kind of leaned in towards me. And my hand went completely numb (I'm not kidding. I couldn't feel anything) but I don't care. It was so sweet. So then we traveresed the mall twice, stopping in Books-A-Million once...and then decided to go to Chick-Fil-A to get something to eat. So we sat and talked and ate for about thirty minutes, then I drove him back to his car. We wanted to work on the last ten seconds since we've both had problems with it, so i pulled into a parking space and we sat. And sat. And laughed nervously. I knew I wanted to kiss him, but wasn't going to ask. But then I started realizing he wanted to kiss me, but wasn't going to ask. Seriously, some dialogue-   Me: "So, do you wanna *Voice crack*"  Andrew; "Should we *voice crack*"   I mean, we seriously could not say it. So then, I said...   Me: "I think I know what you're trying to say."  Andrew: "So...do...you want to?"  Me: "I guess so."   Then we had to actually do it...it eventually ended up with me having to suggest a countdown situation, if we got that desparate, so we ultimately just did it.   And so we have kissed. And I don't think I've ever been this happy. And I know he feels the same way based on his previous blog entry. It's so weird that something so small and insignificant could affect us like this. But it was a good kiss. And a KISS.   This might be the happiest I've ever been in my life.  posted by Nick @ Sunday, November 23, 2003  Saturday, November 22, 2003  ermagetton [9:15 PM]: hey nick...i mean...member of the confederate army!!

We're figuring they won't be smart enough to change the questions when we start answering them all correctly  Nickmac11 [9:23 PM]: We're stealing Paul's idea and stealing a locker to deposit questions  Nickmac11 [9:24 PM]: And the current plan is to carry a textbook with you at all times. My plan was to just knock the person unconscious should they engage you, but that wasn't allowed  ermagetton [9:25 PM]: don't set up a website  ermagetton [9:25 PM]: AT ALL  ermagetton [9:25 PM]: that is seriously the worst idea ever  Nickmac11 [9:25 PM]: Passworded  ermagetton [9:25 PM]: the union had one last year  ermagetton [9:25 PM]: passworded  ermagetton [9:25 PM]: and we hacked in  ermagetton [9:25 PM]: and read it  Nickmac11 [9:25 PM]: Oooh  Nickmac11 [9:25 PM]: I'll share that bit of ino  Nickmac11 [9:25 PM]: *Info  ermagetton [9:26 PM]: e-mail is the easiest thing...no chance of traitors...there are always going to be the people who die the first day, don't care and give the password away  Nickmac11 [9:26 PM]: Okay then  ermagetton [9:26 PM]: and no one wants to give away their e-mail password  Nickmac11 [9:26 PM]: We heard about the subsequent suicides and treacherous going ons of last year's war  Nickmac11 [9:27 PM]: Page didn't a pretty accurate imitation of Trey Mauldwin giving up  ermagetton [9:27 PM]: hahahahaha  ermagetton [9:27 PM]: his suicide  ermagetton [9:27 PM]: it was excellent  Nickmac11 [9:28 PM]: And something about Josh Kight nearly being killed, both figuratively and literally  ermagetton [9:28 PM]: hahahaha  ermagetton [9:29 PM]: yeah  Nickmac11 [9:29 PM]: I'm so excited  ermagetton [9:29 PM]: he gave the confederacy all his questions...apparently, i never knew about it  ermagetton [9:29 PM]: who is your general...robin?

I so had that idea!  ermagetton [9:37 PM]: awesome!!  Nickmac11 [9:37 PM]: To put people who were in trouble in the middle of a pack of people who were either dead or had lots of rations to shuttle them to class  ermagetton [9:38 PM]: oh and you MUST know the questions the other team has for you...i got ambushed by 9 people and walked away with two more ration cards then i had when i was first ambushed  ermagetton [9:38 PM]: all because i answered their questions right  ermagetton [9:38 PM]: they were dumbfounded  ermagetton [9:38 PM]: and they were losing cards on their territory...there is nothing sweeter  Nickmac11 [9:38 PM]: We've all ready started to get spies for us...and we're doing everything possible to make sure everybody knows the questions  Nickmac11 [9:38 PM]: Because we're outnumbered insanely  ermagetton [9:38 PM]: which is a goood GOOD thing  Nickmac11 [9:39 PM]: Well...it has it's pros and cons  Nickmac11 [9:39 PM]: More people to ambush us...but more stupid people for us to take rations from  ermagetton [9:40 PM]: i can't stress this enough...you each get 4 ration cards and a life (on average) they each get 4 ration cards and a life...you have 20 people, they have 57...they can only get 20 times 5 more rations than they had...you can get 57 times 5  Nickmac11 [9:40 PM]: I KNOW THIS!  Nickmac11 [9:40 PM]: I understand the ration situation...but there are still more people to ambush us...that's pretty much the only drawback  ermagetton [9:40 PM]: yes...but you have to ambush first...get as many cards as you can at the VERY beginning, and then you won't have to worry  Nickmac11 [9:40 PM]: I know...we're going after four of their generals the first day  Nickmac11 [9:40 PM]: Simon isn't going to last past day one  ermagetton [9:40 PM]: you have d and b building...no problem...station people in d and b building...and then YOU ambush THEM  Nickmac11 [9:41 PM]: You know that pillar you see us hanging out at?  ermagetton [9:41 PM]: hahahahaha  ermagetton [9:41 PM]: yeah  Nickmac11 [9:41 PM]: Let's see...me Liz, heidi, Andrew, page, Robin and whoever else we can grab are going to lie in wait for Theo since the parking lot is free gam  Nickmac11 [9:41 PM]: And then take him out  Nickmac11 [9:41 PM]: And then I'm sprinting to class  ermagetton [9:42 PM]: make sure he is dumb, because he can ask you questions back  Nickmac11 [9:43 PM]: I know...he's smart...but he can ask us each one question...whereas we can ask him as many as there are of us  Nickmac11 [9:43 PM]: So the maximum each of us could lose is one, while he could lose all  ermagetton [9:43 PM]: and you might not know his obscure questions...i would advise your first ambush be on your territory  ermagetton [9:43 PM]: but he could also get like 5  ermagetton [9:43 PM]: that's not true  ermagetton [9:43 PM]: he would have to be real prepared  Nickmac11 [9:44 PM]: Yep  Nickmac11 [9:44 PM]: Well...we've all ready scheduled some meeting over the break next week to prepare...so I'll suggest your ideas then  Nickmac11 [9:44 PM]: Who else are we going after...  Nickmac11 [9:44 PM]: It's mainly just Simon and Theo because Liz and Heidi and I have Physics with them and so we can get them before and after Physics on the first day because we'll have the B Building  Nickmac11 [9:45 PM]: Because, as soon as the territories switch, they can go after us  Nickmac11 [9:46 PM]: And if both are still alive, we're lying to Simon's dad saying we have to go somewhere before the bell rings...and then running like hell  ermagetton [9:47 PM]: hahahah  Nickmac11 [9:47 PM]: Any other possible tips?  ermagetton [9:48 PM]: they will switch half way through the second day (it is only 3 days this year right?)  ermagetton [9:48 PM]: um...don't cheat, try as much as possible not to  ermagetton [9:48 PM]: they will bring it up at appomatox  ermagetton [9:48 PM]: and it is real annoying  ermagetton [9:49 PM]: and then you get a fit because you try to explain to adam (excuse me, general grant) that WE DID NOT CHEAT, we won because we were awesome and organized and a close knit group  Nickmac11 [9:50 PM]: Yes, we've been warned of cheating  Nickmac11 [9:50 PM]: And the tardy policy  Nickmac11 [9:50 PM]: Which sucks, but what can you do?  Nickmac11 [9:51 PM]: Otherwise, I'd be hiding in the darkroom whenever the Union gets the B Building  ermagetton [9:51 PM]: hahahaha  ermagetton [9:51 PM]: don't slack off the first day...that will make or break an army  Nickmac11 [9:51 PM]: We're not  Nickmac11 [9:51 PM]: I promise you  Nickmac11 [9:51 PM]: We're taking down as many generals and stupid people as possible the first day  ermagetton [9:51 PM]: the more you ambush/kill the better...we killed 3 people before school started the first day of the war  Nickmac11 [9:52 PM]: Ha ha ha  Nickmac11 [9:52 PM]: Yeah, Darcey said something about Norrie hiding in her car until you and Elisha got to school  ermagetton [9:52 PM]: we killed 3 generals...throughout the whole duration...one being candace, but i didn't know her then, couldn't feel bad, had to move on you know  ermagetton [9:52 PM]: hahah yeah  Nickmac11 [9:52 PM]: I have no remorse for killing any of these people...this was supposed to be our game  Nickmac11 [9:52 PM]: Besides, that 100 on a test grade is pretty damn good  ermagetton [9:53 PM]: always go in packs...one person = ambush = dead person  Nickmac11 [9:53 PM]: Yep, we've established that  ermagetton [9:53 PM]: OH!!  Nickmac11 [9:53 PM]: Yes?  ermagetton [9:53 PM]: that brings up another point  Nickmac11 [9:53 PM]: Revelation?  ermagetton [9:53 PM]: do every fucking thing on the list he has you to do  Nickmac11 [9:53 PM]: Hmm?  ermagetton [9:53 PM]: i mean EVERY FUCKING THING...and do it better  Nickmac11 [9:53 PM]: What list?

But there was always some obstacle in the way. Something to be got through first, some unfinished business, time still to be served, a debt to be paid. Then life would begin. At last it dawned on me that these obstacles were my life."  -Dr. Alfred D'Souza  posted by Nick @ Tuesday, November 04, 2003  Who Am I?   I don't know. I truly am lost in my own thoughts and amazement at certain things in the world. I have never onced stopped to think for myself. I've lied to myself, I've made myself feel as if I were the most inadequate human being on earth. So, in asking who am I, I cannot give a definitive answer because there is none. I am no one. Do I have a purpose on this Earth? I'd like to think so, but I just don't see it. Nothing works in my favor. I want to believe in something so badly, yet cannot make myself believe in anything enough to where that something helps me. I am lost. I constantly have one thought override another thought I am having and I hate that. I constantly feel as if i should write down every little thought I am having, if nothing but to be able to organize everything I want to say. I am a student who can never be satisfied. I make grades that discourage me, yet, for my entire life, no matter how hard I study or prepare for a test or quiz or paper, I always make the same grades. It happens even if I don't prepare for the material. I still make the same grades. I am confused. Again, what purpose am I supposed to serve on this earth? I am insignificant in a world of insignificance. I HAVE NO PUPOSE. This frustrates me. I want to do something with my life. I feel as if everyone has some purpose but I look at myself and I see someone who has none. I write constantly, yet nothing ever comes from my writing. I do not pursue possible publishing agents even though I know people who know people who could help me with that. I am me. I think that is the best conclusion I can come to, regardless of how cliched it might sound. There is no other way to say it. There is no one else like me, and I am glad. If my purpose on Earth is just to do that, then that's fine.   What Do I Want?   I want love. I crave friendship to the point where I will go out of my way just to make sure I don't make a person even slightly irritated with me. I've avoided dating people for a while now until last year when it seemed to just fall into my lap and I thought "If I don't take a risk now, I may never get it again" I do not simply want the traditional thought of love...I just want to feel as if someone is dependent upon me and needs me and could somehow not survive without me. I want my life to, for once, be simple. It has never been easy. I've tried to live it in a straight path without any outside distractions, but it seems the more I try to avoid this, the more it comes for me through situations beyond my control. I want to know that I have a purpose. I want to have a significant other in my future. I want to be able to help my friends when they need it. Furthermore, I want my friends to be able to tell other people their secrets. Somehow, this year, all of my friends have told me, and exclusively me, things about themselves that they don't want others to know. Perhaps I should be considered so lucky that I am considered so trustworthy and that my friends consider me a good enough friend to tell me. I want to be able to take complete control of my life and be able to decide what I am going to do and HOW I'm going to do it. And, at this time, I want a summer vacation. NOW.  posted by Nick @ Tuesday, November 04, 2003    Tuesday, December 30, 2003  LIFE AFTER GOD QUOTES   Some day you cross this thin line and you really realize that we need to protect ourselves from ourselves. -Pg. 6   Time, Baby -- so much, so much time left until the end of my life -- sometimes I go crazy at how slowly time passes yet how quickly my body ages. But I shouldn't allow myself to think like this. I have to remind myself that time only rightens me when i think of having to spend it alone. Sometimes I scare myself with how many of my thoughts revolve around making me feel better about sleeping alone in a room -Pg. 18   "What do you think dying is like?" Cathy said it was like you're in a store and a friend drives up to the front door in a beautiful car and says "Hop in -- let's go on a trip!" and so you go out for a spin. And once you're out on the road and having a great time, suddenly your friend turns to you and says "Oh, by the way, you're dead," and you realize they're right, but it doesn't matter because you're happy and this is an adventure and this is fine. -Pg. 37   And there were Christian radio stations, too, so many many stations, and the voices on them seemed so enthusiastic and committed. They sounded like they sincerely believed in what they were saying, and so, for once, I decided to pay attention to these stations, trying to figure out what exactly it was they were believing, trying to understand the notion of belief. The stations talked about Jesus and salvation and I found it pretty hard listening because these religious type are always so whacked out and extreme. I think they take things too literally and miss many points because of this literalism. This has always been the basic flaw with religion -- or so I had been taught, and so (I realized) I had come to believe. So at least I knew one thing for sure that I believed in. The radio stations all seemed to be talking about Jesus nonstop, and it seemed to be this crazy orgy of prjection, with everyone projecting onto Jesus the antidotes to the things that had gone wrong in their own lives. He is Love. He is Forgiveness. He is Compassion. He is a Wise Career Decision. He is a Child Who Loves Me. I was feeling a sense of loss as I heard these people. I felt like Jesus was sex -- or rather, Jesus I felt like I was from another world where sex did not exist and I arrived on Earth and everyone talked about how good sex felt, and showed me their pornography and built their lives around sex, and yet I was forever cut off from the true sexual experience. I did not deny that the existence of Jesus was real to these people -- it was merely that I was cut off from their experience in a way that was never connectable. And yet I had to ask myself over and over what it was these radio people were seeing in the face of Jesus. They sounded like their lives had once been so messed up and lost as they spoke; at least they were no longer so lost anymore -- like AA people. So I figured that was a good thing. -Pgs. 182-184   And then I felt sad because I realized that once people are broken in certain ways, they can't ever be fixed, and this is something nobody ever tells you when you are young and it never fails to surprise you as you grow older as you see people in your life break one by one. You wonder when your turn is going to be or if it's already happened. -Pg. 207   This past week has gotten me to wondering about life. Well, not life exactly -- but the sequence of life's events. Does, for instance, it matter in life that we travel through our days from A to B to C to D...birth to love to marriage to children to death, and so forth? Or is this storyboard device we're stuck with as humans to try to make sense of our iffy situation here on Earth? As I have said, this past week has gotten me wondering about this. -Pg. 217   Every day each of us experiences a few little moments that have just a bit more resonance than other moments -- we hear a word that sticks in our mind -- or maybe we have a small experience that us out of ourselves, if only briefly -- we share a hotel elevator with a bride in her veils, say, or a stranger gives us a piece of bread to feed to the mallard ducks in the lagoon; a small child starts a conversation with us at a Dairy Queen -- or we have and episode like the one I had with the M&amp;M cars back at the Husky station. And if we were to collect these small moments in a notebook and save them over a period of months we would see certain trends emerge from our collection -- certain voices would emerge that have been trying to speak through us. We would realize that we have been having another life altogether, one we didn't even know was going on inside us. And maybe this other life is more important than the one we think of as being real -- this clunky day-to-day world of furniture and noise and metal. So just maybe it is these small moments which are the real story-making events of our lives. -Pgs. 254-255   Our conversations are never easy but as I -- we -- get older, we are all finding that our conversations must be spoken. A need burns inside us to share with others what we are feeling. Beyond a certain age, sincerity ceases to feel pornographic. It is as though the coolness that marked our youth is itself a type of retrovirus that can only leave you feeling empty. Full of holes. -Pg. 280  posted by Nick @ Tuesday, December 30, 2003  Thursday, December 25, 2003  It's a miracle. It truly is. Whenever I look back on this, that's the only way I could ever see to describe it. How often does something like this happen? How often does it turn out to be this wonderful? It's scary to think of how . . lucky, I truly am. Or blessed.   Someone who cares. Someone who listens. Someone who I don't feel ashamed to tell about my jealousy. Someone who I can tell every last one of my secrets to. Someone that I actually want to tell every last one of my secrets to. Someone who I can flirt with, like I had just met them. Someone who's a friend. My best friend. Someone with these quirky little things about them. Someone who knows how I feel, on numerous subjects. Someone that I can laugh with. Someone that I can sit with, and not say a single word to, but just be with them. Someone who's cultured. Someone who I want to run away to Mexico with, and leave the rest of my life behind. Someone that I know is better than me in every aspect, someone that I know that I don't deserve, and yet . . . here I am.   How lucky am I? This is EXACTLY how I feel about Andrew...and to have him feel the same way...I'm so lucky.   posted by Nick @ Thursday, December 25, 2003    Saturday, January 31, 2004  I haven't really updated this with any substantial information for a while.   What can I say? I have a LiveJournal now, and I'm mostly taking advantage of their private post feature.   So I might delete this one.   But I like this one too much. It's like a crazy little fangirl. I look back, and there is no negative energy.   But...No, I'm going to have to make a slightly negative post. It's not really negative, because the fact I could do something like this just makes me love Andrew even more, and the fact that he negated everything I said makes me want to cry tears of joy.   So...a Blow by Blow, if you will.   There's so much to talk about, actually, that I'll never be able to write it all down. But I love him more than ever. I do. He is the one for me, and I know this. And if he isn't, and there is somebody better for me, then I'll be shocked.   I love you, Andrew. I love you. I don't ever want to lose you. I can't imagine losing you. I think it would kill me.  posted by Nick @ Saturday, January 31, 2004  Sunday, January 18, 2004   Rain: You are the sound of rain. You have two  important sides. There is your strong, powerful  side and your calm, gentle side. Both are very  important. Rain also reflects a bit of darkness  in your personality. It isn't bad, just shows  that along with the good, you also can see bad,  which can come in handy. (please rate my quiz)    What Sound Are You?(now w/ pics)  brought to you by Quizilla  posted by Nick @ Sunday, January 18, 2004    Sunday, February 08, 2004  So...yesterday with Andrew.   I got kind of annoyed with him for the first time.   It only lasted a few minutes, but still.   Anyways, we had stopped by a Target, and he bought some Resse's and a Sunkist. Then we go get my car, head over to Concord Mills. Except, somehow, on the way over there, he begins to act very childish, and it felt as if I was having to take care of a child. He just began to do some strange things, like making faces at passing cars, fake stabbing me with the Sunkist bottle, etc. It was funny for the first few minutes, but then...it became kind of odd, because I haven't really seen Andrew that...immature. And so I ultimately had to take the Sunkist bottle, throw it in my backseat and tell him to calm down. I don't know if he could sense the irritation in my voice, but he did stop...eventually.   Regardless, I love him. I had a great time last night with him.  Sunday, April 25, 2004  I think the only reason I'm updating this blog with something relevant is because I don't think Andrew reads this blog. And what I want to say...I'm not sure if I do or do not want him to read it. So...I'll settle for the unknown.   I have no good way to segue into this. I feel like we need to talk, over the phone, in person, just talk, because I truly do not want to lose you as a friend. Do you realize what that would mean, if we were no longer friends? We could never talk to each other, never acknowledge the other, etc. It can never happen. We can't not be friends because that requires us never talking or doing anything ever again. And if you say that's not true, then you obviously don't know what you're talking about when you say you don't think we can be friends anymore.   I still would like a concrete, solid reason WHY you feel we can't be friends. As far as I've understood, it's because of what's going on between Landon and I. I have told you time and time again I DON'T think you should be involved and I don't plan on talking to you about it ever. Yearbook, all I said was that I was sorry you were involved. That was going to be the extent of my involving you.   For some reason, it just seems like you derive joy in making me miserable. Because over the course of the past three weeks, you have hurt me more and more. You lie to me when you break up with me, you lie to me when you say you aren't dating anyone, you say you love me but can never date me, you say that maybe you didn't want to break up with me, you never tell me you think you need time apart so I feel like you hate me when you didn't answer my phone calls, you tell me you might want to try again someday, you say you don't think we can be friends...when's it going to end, Andrew? Are you trying to make me hate you? Because you're doing a fucking good job of it.   I know you'll never actually call me and I know we'll never have a chance to talk about this again, so I'll let it stay there. As Landon said about you: "He needs to stop being such a pussy and talk to you about it". Because I want to know the exact reason you think we can't be friends, because the reason I've gotten from you so far is bullshit.   If you don't want to call me or talk to me (And I don't expect you to, which is really disappointing...that I know you well enough to know you'll ignore me) then TALK TO SOMEONE ABOUT THIS. NOT Landon. Talk to someone who has no situation in this. Jennifer or Heidi. Then lets talk.  posted by Nick @ Sunday, April 25, 2004  Monday, April 19, 2004  messieJesse [6:44 PM]: wanna play the truth game?

You need safety in your relationship.  You want to be sure in his/her arms, knowing  that he will protect you and you can be totally  devoted to your other. At this point you are  very vulnerable. You open yourself and dont  even think that he/she could cheat you. You  totally trust your partner in every single way.  SO if you find out that she/he lied to you or  played a game this trust is broken. You may try  to forgive your other but this will be very  difficult.He/She has to be friendly and  trustworthy.  PLEASE VOTE, I want to know what you think about my  quiz, I worked hard on it.  You can always message me or tell me how I can  improve that quiz. Ill sure write back.    ~THE big LOVE TEST!!

Nickmac11 [12:37 PM]: Can I ask you two things? I need some...advice  ermagetton [12:37 PM]: sure  Nickmac11 [12:38 PM]: I be fine  ermagetton [12:38 PM]: go ahead  Nickmac11 [12:38 PM]: Okay, first, what did you and Andrew talk about last night when you called him away?  ermagetton [12:38 PM]: i asked him why he was being weird  Nickmac11 [12:38 PM]: Ah  Nickmac11 [12:39 PM]: Okay, then the second thing would be...hmm...the best way to word this  ermagetton [12:39 PM]: like a band-aid...spit it out  Nickmac11 [12:40 PM]: It feels like, in this relationship, I'm being too possessive, and at the same time, he's trying to make sure that he spends an equal amount of time with every group of his friends and so I feel like I've been regulated to just a "good friend" status...I guess I'm afraid he might beng growing tired of me, or something  Nickmac11 [12:41 PM]: I thought that's what you two were talking about last night, which is why I asked so I could segue into that  ermagetton [12:41 PM]: hahaha  ermagetton [12:42 PM]: nice segue  Nickmac11 [12:42 PM]: Oh yeah  ermagetton [12:42 PM]: well  Nickmac11 [12:42 PM]: You must love being the one everyone comes to for advice  ermagetton [12:42 PM]: i think that maybe possessive is a harsh term...but i think you might be asking too much from him...he seems to be spreading himself thin  ermagetton [12:42 PM]: haha, it gives me something to do  Nickmac11 [12:43 PM]: Maybe not possessive...dependant, I guess  ermagetton [12:44 PM]: well...the party is a prime example  Nickmac11 [12:44 PM]: How?  ermagetton [12:45 PM]: it seems like he has freaked himself into this mindset where he has to be with you and have fun with you...but he isn't like you...he is the extrovert, you are the introvert...his time at parties are spent differently than yours  Nickmac11 [12:46 PM]: I'm going to have to disagree for the pure fact that he has cut each of our outings short since Feb. 14th to go be with another group of friends  ermagetton [12:46 PM]: but that doesn't mean he has blown you off  Nickmac11 [12:47 PM]: I wouldn't say he's blown me off...it just feels like he's trying to make time for each group of his friends, and I'm always the last person on his list he comes to...so I feel like I'm just his friend  ermagetton [12:47 PM]: i mean, this might be where possessive has come into play...i ma not saying you are...but i think it would behouve (sp?) you to look at it from his side...i mean...i see your point, but i think we are short changing andrew's role in all this  Nickmac11 [12:48 PM]: I'm just worried that I've become too possessive/dependant to the point where it's starting to affect our relationship...because...I feel like I'm annoying him all the time, now  Nickmac11 [12:48 PM]: It feels like he would gladly trade his time with me for more time with, say, Charlotte and Landon  ermagetton [12:49 PM]: well, if you feel like that, then reduce your possessiveness...i mean...let him have his buddy nights...and i know you love him and you want to see him all the time...but sometimes it doesn't work like that...or it can't  ermagetton [12:49 PM]: maybe his social time  Nickmac11 [12:49 PM]: But, see that's the thing- He's had his "buddy nights" every single saturday since Feb. 14th  ermagetton [12:50 PM]: they areb his friends though...if i could have a buddy night every weekend, i would...high school is coming to a close  Nickmac11 [12:50 PM]: True...  Nickmac11 [12:51 PM]: Ugh, I don't know  ermagetton [12:51 PM]: but really...don't take this like i am attacking your relationship approach...just...if you want to improve...then maybe try new things  Nickmac11 [12:51 PM]: I just feel like it's gotten to a point where he views me now as just a friend, not really a boyfriend  Nickmac11 [12:51 PM]: And that, at any day, he's going to say that to me and we will officially be "just friends"  ermagetton [12:53 PM]: if you feel this way...then is the relationship really strong enough to be more than friends?  Nickmac11 [12:54 PM]: Yes, without a doubt  Nickmac11 [12:54 PM]: It's mainly more of my paranoia that I'm annoying him about wanting to spend more time with him  ermagetton [12:55 PM]: i have two pieces of advice  Nickmac11 [12:55 PM]: I've always been constantly afraid to fuck something up in this relationship, and I guess this is just a severe reaction from me that I am fucking something up  ermagetton [12:56 PM]: ok  ermagetton [12:56 PM]: well my advice:  ermagetton [12:57 PM]: 1) i think that you are right, you might be potentially pushing andrew away...but i think a good plan of action is to maybe...attempt to open up more to andrew's friends/your friends/social situations in general...then you can be with him while he is with his friends  Nickmac11 [12:57 PM]: Okay. Yeah, I've been...trying to do that (Not that easy for me, but I've been trying)  ermagetton [12:57 PM]: and 2) take a break from wanting him all the time...and take what you get and build from there...no matter how frustrating, not having him at all will be 10 times more frustrating  Nickmac11 [12:58 PM]: Hmm...  Nickmac11 [12:59 PM]: Hmm...  ermagetton [1:00 PM]: last night...could have been opportunities for you...i mean...you don't have to dance, but just...putyourself out there  Nickmac11 [1:00 PM]: I know but...ugh...how do I explain this  Nickmac11 [1:01 PM]: I don't like Jeremy at all, Diana would never strike up a conversation with me or hold one with me for more than one minute, Landon hangs around Jeremy all the time...so that leaves you, Charlotte, Sara and Andrew...and Sara was always around Diana...I get scared in situations like that  Nickmac11 [1:01 PM]: Believe me, I wanted to use last night as an oppurtunity to get to know people like Landon and Charlotte better....I really just don't know how  ermagetton [1:02 PM]: you should...suck it up...hang out with people you don't like but focus on the people you do...i don't like katie b...so i had conversations with others...or i just focused my attention on others  Nickmac11 [1:02 PM]: But it's like the people I do like were never not with the people I don't like  ermagetton [1:03 PM]: exactly  ermagetton [1:03 PM]: you can't help that  ermagetton [1:03 PM]: you have to take the good with the bad  Nickmac11 [1:03 PM]: I guess  ermagetton [1:04 PM]: trust me...people will like you less if you seem to hate them, than if you try  Nickmac11 [1:04 PM]: Hmm...  Nickmac11 [1:04 PM]: You know, with all the advice I've gotten on trying to be more extroverted, I could write a book on the subject  ermagetton [1:05 PM]: then why don't you use it?  ermagetton [1:05 PM]: are you afriad?  ermagetton [1:05 PM]: afraid  ermagetton [1:05 PM]: actually  ermagetton [1:05 PM]: i take everything back  ermagetton [1:05 PM]: you don't have to be extroverted  ermagetton [1:06 PM]: really...someday, you are going to find someone else who is introverted and who you can really be with  Nickmac11 [1:06 PM]: No, I don't want that  Nickmac11 [1:07 PM]: The extroverted thing is purely for me...it has nothing to do with our relationship  ermagetton [1:07 PM]: do you want to be extroverted? or do you just want to be able to be with other people socially  ermagetton [1:07 PM]: ?  Nickmac11 [1:07 PM]: The latter  Nickmac11 [1:07 PM]: But it seems like I need to be extroverted in order to do that  Nickmac11 [1:08 PM]: Not like Diana/Sara extroverted...just...able to srike up conversations  ermagetton [1:08 PM]: you don't have to be anything  ermagetton [1:08 PM]: listen...  ermagetton [1:09 PM]: you are yourself...and if that doesn't mesh with some people...or if that doesn't fit with other's ideas of fun...then you don't have to be friends with them...you should have to force it  ermagetton [1:09 PM]: it should be natural  Nickmac11 [1:09 PM]: Hmm...  ermagetton [1:09 PM]: and if it doesn't work, if you can't do it...or if you can't want to do it, then it won't happen  ermagetton [1:09 PM]: this is a sign that somehting isn't right  Nickmac11 [1:09 PM]: Hmm...  Nickmac11 [1:09 PM]: With the relationship?  Nickmac11 [1:10 PM]: Again, this really has nothing to do with me and Andrew  ermagetton [1:10 PM]: with the relationship, with the frienships, with your self esteem  Nickmac11 [1:10 PM]: Why would it be a sign with the relationship?  ermagetton [1:11 PM]: if you can't mesh with him in public...and you two look like you did last night when together in public...or if you feel you need to eb an extrovert in order to be friends with his friends...then something isn't right  ermagetton [1:11 PM]: not rwrong but off  ermagetton [1:12 PM]: i have to go  ermagetton [1:12 PM]: but i will be back later  ermagetton [1:12 PM]: bye  Nickmac11 [1:12 PM]: Okay  Nickmac11 [1:12 PM]: Bye  ermagetton signed off at 1:12 PM  posted by Nick @ Sunday, April 04, 2004  Thursday, April 01, 2004  I'm kind of...in a state of...love. Yes, love is the best way to put it. I LOVE someone. And they love me. And we know this. And we're okay. We haven't done anything insane. We simply fell in love.   Because I guess that's how it happened.   The first moment I think I really knew was when I was driving home, fighting the incredible urge to turn back around because I wanted nothing more than to be with you.   I'm not experiencing this too early. I know that I LOVE someone. That I want to be with them for the rest of my life because, as far as I am concerned, they are that "soulmate" for me. The person who completes me. The person who, when they are happy, I am happy. When they are sad, I am sad. Hearing their voice simply calms me and makes me feel better. When I'm not with them, my thoughts drift to them.   I wish it was the two of us, for one day. Nobody interupting us. A saturday can finally be for just us. Where I can lie with my arms around you and kiss you and shut my eyes and relax and feel as if there is not one person I would rather be or be with at that time.   That state of love.   It's quite nice.   I hope you all get to experience someday. All those couples out there...Liz and Simon, Robin and Eli, Conner and Beef, Elisha and Dustin, Amanda and Lee...for all I know, you may be in love with each other. And to that I say, congratulations, because I know how that feels. And I know it's a really nice feeling.   And people, I have to say, had I not taken a huge risk, this would have never happened. ACT upon your crushes. I know you have them. The worst that can happen is that the person you have a crush on says no. It might hurt for a day or two, but at least you'll be able to get over them. Take fucking risks. I took one, and I'm in love because of it.   (And now I'm thinking I really shouldn't post this entry, but to hell with it. I'm posting it.)   It needed to be said.   And thus Nickus spake.  Sunday, May 30, 2004  To you-   I want you to know, that I'm happy for you  I wish nothing but the best for you both  An older version of me  Is she perverted like me  Would she go down on you in a theatre  Does she speak eloquently  And would she have your baby  I'm sure she'd make a really excellent mother   Cause the love that you gave that we made wasn't able  To make it enough for you to be open wide, no  And every time you speak her name  Does she know how you told me you'd hold me  Until you died, till you died  But you're still alive   And I'm here to remind you  Of the mess you left when you went away  It's not fair to deny me  Of the cross I bear that you gave to me  You, you, you oughta know   You seem very well, things look peaceful  I'm not quite as well, I thought you should know  Did you forget about me Mr. Duplicity  I hate to bug you in the middle of dinner  It was a slap in the face how quickly I was replaced  Are you thinking of me when you fuck her   Cause the love that you gave that we made wasn't able  To make it enough for you to be open wide, no  And every time you speak her name  Does she know how you told me you'd hold me  Until you died, til you died  But you're still alive   And I'm here to remind you  Of the mess you left when you went away  It's not fair to deny me  Of the cross I bear that you gave to me  You, you, you oughta know   Cause the joke that you laid on the bed that was me  And I'm not gonna fade  As soon as you close your eyes and you know it   And every time I scratch my nails down someone else's back  I hope you feel it...well can you feel it   And I'm here to remind you  Of the mess you left when you went away  It's not fair to deny me  Of the cross I bear that you gave to me  You, you, you oughta know    Love, Nick  posted by Nick @ Sunday, May 30, 2004 0 comments  Saturday, May 29, 2004  Okay, that conversation proved my point. The fact that we talked like friends...I don't feel anything towards him anymore. I don't have any desire to get back together. I simply feel like we're friends and that we can talk and that this is good.   So...okay.  posted by Nick @ Saturday, May 29, 2004 0 comments  Wednesday, May 26, 2004  I should be MWDSing right now. What the hell, I can always fo it during Yearbook tomorrow and Physics on friday.   Um...I don't know.   I just can't bring myself to accept what Jennifer said about best friends.. I mean, I don't think you can just tell someone who is and isn't their best friend. I don't have to be Andrew's best friend; that sentiment isn't always reciprocated, but Andrew is my best friend. We haven't done anything in a while because it'd be weird, the breakup is still recent. Over the summer we'll probably do something (I would hope, at least, even if it's with Heidi or someone). But he is the only person I would confide in about everything. I do enjoy talking to him. I might not be Andrew's best friend (I don't think I am) and that's okay. However, he is my best friend.   I don't know. I'm just...frustrated. With Landon. Not like that, though. I'm frustrated because of how jealous I'm getting of Landon. He's getting everything I wanted. Everything I wanted in the relationship and fought to get, Landon is getting. I wanted to go to prom with Andrew so badly. I just wanted one dance. I wanted to be able to tell him that I loved him on his blog. I wanted him to be able to tell me that (I regret freaking out about that so much, now.) on my blog. I just wanted to be a couple, dammit! We hid that relationship for so long and I never got to actually be able to display my love for him at school. Landon, on the other hand, gets to. He gets it immediatly.   I wish I could go back and repeat October through March and do things differently. Either that, or I wish I would somehow get the oppurtunity to date Andrew again and be able to do those things. Hell, who knows, we might. There isn't anyone else at Northwest I would even consider dating, and I think the same is true of Andrew. I know this sounds like I'm saying as soon as Landon and Andrew break up, he'll run back to me, but that won't happen, I'm sure of it. He'd have to get another crush on me, which could always happen.   I feel like Andrew doesn't...value me, I guess, as a friend. Like, all the stuff he told me about letting him realize he could be with another guy and be in love and all that stuff...it just feels like that doesn't even register to him, like I was just a six month fling to him. It just...I just wish he would tell me that he does still thank me for that stuff. If it wasn't for me, he probably wouldn't be dating Landon. Hey, he has me to thank for that (Ha ha ha...I guess...I mean, would he have come out to Landon? Who knows). But...just one statement from him that could nullify what I feel would be nice. It'd be the least he could do.   I just want to know how he feels regarding us as just friends, because sometimes I get mixed feelings. Sometimes it seems like he wants nothing to do with me and sometimes it seems like he'd love to talk to me. I really don't want to go back to the way we were. I wish I could call him just to talk, but I always feel like that would annoy him. I wish he could call me sometimes to just talk about life. Why can't we do that? I can call Jesse or Heidi and do the same thing, but I still withhold things from them. That, and that Andrew is interesting to talk to.   I don't know.   Looking back at the only two entries I ever posted on my blog where I, I guess, declared my love for him...that's such an awesome thing that I went through that.   And I feel like he never really loved me. Because...and this is purely my opinion...of how much he says it to Landon. I mean, I know he said he didn't think he was in love with Landon, but...I don't know. Is it really possible to fall in love twice in seven/eight months in high school? Maybe the reason I wish they'd stop saying it is because I want it to be me he's saying it to. I still don't believe it's love, but whatever. I guess it just feels like the love Andrew had for me is being cheapened and it's impact it had on me isn't that great anymore. I guess an example would be that entry he did on his private blog. He says he'll always love me, I'll always have a piece of his heart. I just feel, now, like he said that purely because he thought that is what I wanted to hear. I wish he would tell me if that still holds true. I mean, obviously, he doesn't LOVE me anymore, but...you know what I mean.   I wish we would talk more.   And how ironic that Andrew latched onto "That Particular Time" when we first started dating and now I've latched onto it after it ended.   Andrew, let's go do something. Or just talk on the phone about life for just 30 minutes, if that's all you want. I just want to actually, truly feel like we have a friendship and you don't hate me, because I feel that too often now.   I wish we would talk more. I really do.  posted by Nick @ Wednesday, May 26, 2004 0 comments  Tuesday, May 25, 2004  Nickmac11 [7:52 PM]: Jennifer?  ermagetton [7:52 PM]: yessss?

And I know I've brought some of it upon myself it's just...everything was so much easier back when I was still dating Andrew  Nickmac11 [7:56 PM]: At least, back in Jan/Dec when I was still dating Andrew  Nickmac11 [7:56 PM]: This isn't a "I Miss Andrew" conversation, by the way, just to warn you  ermagetton [7:56 PM]: ok  ermagetton [7:56 PM]: good  ermagetton [7:56 PM]: i was going to nip that in the bud  Nickmac11 [7:57 PM]: That's just the time period I refer to because it's the best I've felt  Nickmac11 [7:57 PM]: And since then...it's just so...AGH!  ermagetton [7:57 PM]: well that doesn't mean that if it continued with him you two would have been happy  ermagetton [7:58 PM]: in fact...iit would have continued, you owuld feel worse right now  Nickmac11 [7:59 PM]: I was pretty happy with him  Nickmac11 [8:00 PM]: I wasn't having to deal with all this Landon shit, for instance  Nickmac11 [8:00 PM]: Which is the main reason I IMed you  ermagetton [8:00 PM]: um...no  ermagetton [8:00 PM]: you were pretty happy with him  ermagetton [8:00 PM]: we should understand that  ermagetton [8:00 PM]: you WERE  Nickmac11 [8:00 PM]: Until we broke up  Nickmac11 [8:01 PM]: I was never not happy with Andrew  ermagetton [8:01 PM]: if you two would have stayed...you wouldn't be happy...he wouldn't be happy...and nothing would be going well  ermagetton [8:01 PM]: then you are a little blind, nick  Nickmac11 [8:01 PM]: How?  Nickmac11 [8:02 PM]: I mean, we had our fair share of problems; All relationships do; but I was happy with him. I loved him.  ermagetton [8:02 PM]: obviously somehting wasn't going right...or maybe andrew wasn't happy...but the relationship ended for a reason...and as much as you want to blame landon...he was only there to be living...he didn't force anyhting  Nickmac11 [8:02 PM]: I know Andrew wasn't happy  ermagetton [8:02 PM]: then how could you be happy?  ermagetton [8:02 PM]: how could you be happy knowing he wasn't happy  ermagetton [8:02 PM]: you say you loved him  ermagetton [8:02 PM]: is that love?  Nickmac11 [8:02 PM]: I didn't know he wasn't happy until we broke up  Nickmac11 [8:03 PM]: I don't balme Landon in the sense that he tried to break us up  ermagetton [8:03 PM]: that's what i say...a little blind then  Nickmac11 [8:03 PM]: Yeah, apparently  Nickmac11 [8:03 PM]: I blame Landon just in the sense that Andrew broke up with me for him  Nickmac11 [8:03 PM]: It just sucks because the last time I was involved in drama this massive I had him to talk to and support me and now I'm alone. I mean, friends are nice but it still doesn't compare  Nickmac11 [8:04 PM]: I'm sorry I'm doing this to you, I really am  ermagetton [8:04 PM]: then this is your chance to stand on your own  Nickmac11 [8:04 PM]: But it just seems like everyone is against me  Nickmac11 [8:05 PM]: And I can't do anything about it  Nickmac11 [8:05 PM]: Andrew doesn't believe me, Landon has told lies about me  Nickmac11 [8:05 PM]: And it just...I'm so tired of it. I want to just cry right now from frustration  ermagetton [8:05 PM]: oh nick, HUSH...listen to yourself!  Nickmac11 [8:05 PM]: And, again, I'm really sorry I'm bringing this on you  ermagetton [8:06 PM]: if andrew doesn't belive you...and if landon tells lies about you...then fuck them! who gives a shit...stop trying to get their approval...andrew is with landon now...would it really be appropriate for him to believe you over landon?  Nickmac11 [8:06 PM]: No   Nickmac11 [8:06 PM]: And I understand that  Nickmac11 [8:06 PM]: But he is still my best friend  ermagetton [8:06 PM]: you only say everyone is against...everyone involved in this DRAMA...you have other friends who aren't involved who still support you  ermagetton [8:07 PM]: he is NOT your best friend...best friends don't treat each other like that  Nickmac11 [8:07 PM]: Yeah, I know...  Nickmac11 [8:07 PM]: What has he done to me? What?  Nickmac11 [8:07 PM]: I'm tired of people telling me this stuff  Nickmac11 [8:07 PM]: Yeah, he treated me like shit over the breakup but he's never done that before  Nickmac11 [8:07 PM]: We've moved on from there  Nickmac11 [8:07 PM]: Apparently, everybody knows something I don't  Nickmac11 [8:08 PM]: Because I don't see any reason why I should hate him  Nickmac11 [8:08 PM]: You said it yourself, he was unhappy  ermagetton [8:08 PM]: so what...does he confide in you? does he believe you? does he support you? hang out wiht you?  Nickmac11 [8:08 PM]: Yes, he does confide in me  Nickmac11 [8:08 PM]: Yes, he has believed me some of the time  ermagetton [8:08 PM]: just because you don't hate him does NOT meanhe si automatically your best friend  Nickmac11 [8:08 PM]: Hanging out...didn't you even say we needed time apart  ermagetton [8:08 PM]: you guys can still be friends...no one is denying you that  ermagetton [8:09 PM]: but this is not a best friendship  Nickmac11 [8:09 PM]: I guess...  Nickmac11 [8:09 PM]: I'm sorry  ermagetton [8:11 PM]: uh stop that...don't say it unless you mean it...i am not angry at you...it is just frustrating for me to keep listening to the same things over and over again and see no progress...at some point you just have to dust yourself off, pick up your dignity and walk away from the situation  Nickmac11 [8:11 PM]: I know, that's why I'm sorry  ermagetton [8:11 PM]: and if keeping your dignity means walking away from andrew too, then do it  Nickmac11 [8:11 PM]: I keep feeling like I'm annoying you  Nickmac11 [8:11 PM]: It's hard though!  Nickmac11 [8:12 PM]: I know it's not an excuse, but...I need something like summer to help me fully get over him  Nickmac11 [8:12 PM]: Seeing him everyday isn't helping whatsoever, even if we don't say anything to each other the whole day  ermagetton [8:13 PM]: yeah...i'm sure it is hard...it isn't supposed to be easy  ermagetton [8:13 PM]: so just suck it up  ermagetton [8:13 PM]: once you deal with it...then you can move on  Nickmac11 [8:14 PM]: yeah  Nickmac11 [8:15 PM]: I really am sorry...I just...I don't know who else to talk to  ermagetton [8:16 PM]: it's fine...but you just say the same things  ermagetton [8:16 PM]: i like to help  ermagetton [8:16 PM]: but i can't keep saying the same things  Nickmac11 [8:16 PM]: I know  ermagetton [8:16 PM]: it's pointless  Nickmac11 [8:16 PM]: I know  Nickmac11 [8:19 PM]: Is it wrong of me to wish we had never dated?  ermagetton [8:19 PM]: no  ermagetton [8:19 PM]: quite natural  Nickmac11 [8:20 PM]: It just...we were just so much more friendly with each other before we admitted we had a crush on each other  Nickmac11 [8:20 PM]: And I would much prefer that now  ermagetton [8:23 PM]: yeah, that's how it goes...you can't help that...at least now you aren't wondering about what could have happened  Nickmac11 [8:23 PM]: But at the same time...I don't know  ermagetton [8:23 PM]: you do know  Nickmac11 [8:24 PM]: It just sucks to wish that I had never experienced what I experienced in those six months  ermagetton [8:24 PM]: god, SHUSH!!! you can't chnage it, so why think about it?  Nickmac11 [8:24 PM]: No, I'm not thinking about it  ermagetton [8:24 PM]: you had something special  ermagetton [8:24 PM]: embrace that!  ermagetton [8:24 PM]: and then move on  Nickmac11 [8:24 PM]: Exactly! I don't want to wish it never happened!  ermagetton [8:24 PM]: you can wish it never happened...but in a year you won't be feeling anyhitng about it  ermagetton [8:25 PM]: now you can wish it never happened, but soon you won't feel that way  Nickmac11 [8:25 PM]: Okay  Nickmac11 [8:28 PM]: I didn't mean for this conversation to go this way. I'm still kind of wondering how i did  Nickmac11 [8:28 PM]: *it  ermagetton [8:29 PM]: i mean...i am trying to help you  ermagetton [8:29 PM]: and a swift kick in the ass will hopefully help a hell of a lot more than advice  Nickmac11 [8:29 PM]: I know, and you don't know how thankful I am for that  ermagetton [8:29 PM]: because it hasn't been working  Nickmac11 [8:29 PM]: Ha ha ha...apparently  ermagetton is away at 8:32 PM  posted by Nick @ Tuesday, May 25, 2004 0 comments  Sunday, May 23, 2004  Fourth post in 48 hours...gooooood, Nick.   Zik495 [1:12 AM]: hey  Nickmac11 [1:13 AM]: Hey  Nickmac11 [1:13 AM]: *Sigh*  Nickmac11 [1:13 AM]: Oh, I called Andrew  Nickmac11 [1:14 AM]: He did try marijuana  Zik495 [1:14 AM]: mmm, sorry my phone lost service  Nickmac11 [1:14 AM]: Don't worry  Zik495 [1:14 AM]: that sucks  Nickmac11 [1:14 AM]: Yep  Nickmac11 [1:14 AM]: So, here is the story from Andrew:  Zik495 [1:14 AM]: what'd he say?  Nickmac11 [1:14 AM]: he, Sara, Diana, brittany, David and Sean Ross broke into a hotel room. All of them were on drugs on drinking  Nickmac11 [1:15 AM]: The security guard found them and arrested them, they sat in jail for about 12 hours  Nickmac11 [1:15 AM]: They're all out, by the way  Zik495 [1:15 AM]: they all posted bail?  Nickmac11 [1:15 AM]: They are charged with a few misdemeanors, like possession of illegal substances by a minor  Nickmac11 [1:15 AM]: Yeah  Nickmac11 [1:15 AM]: And they all have one felony, which is burglary in the second degree  Zik495 [1:16 AM]: what did they steal?  Nickmac11 [1:16 AM]: And court dates are late June for the misdemeanors, July for the felony  Nickmac11 [1:16 AM]: They didn't steal anything...they just broke into the hotel room  Nickmac11 [1:16 AM]: A felony...that's pretty big  Zik495 [1:16 AM]: yeah, that stays on your record forever  Nickmac11 [1:16 AM]: I've been doing some research on what the maximum punishments can be, and that's the only one I haven't found  Nickmac11 [1:17 AM]: I'm so disappointed in him. He even said that he was the only one of that group who had something going for him and he fucked it up  Zik495 [1:17 AM]: yeah, my god, where'd he go wrong? did he just not realize?  Zik495 [1:17 AM]: anything?  Nickmac11 [1:17 AM]: That's what I'm wondering  Nickmac11 [1:18 AM]: I mean, I wanted to talk to him more about...WHY he did it, but I woke him up, so he's going to call me tomorrow  Nickmac11 [1:18 AM]: But I even said "You're so smart and to see you do something like trying marijuana and breaking in...why would you do that?"  Zik495 [1:18 AM]: ah, did he say anything to that?  Nickmac11 [1:18 AM]: If he can't get that felony off his record, do you realize how badly that's going to screw him over?  Nickmac11 [1:19 AM]: I think he gave a sullen "I know"  Zik495 [1:19 AM]: sure do. it's a question on college apps, you ever been convicted of a felony?  Nickmac11 [1:19 AM]: By the way, can you see if you can find the sentence for burglary in the second degree by a minor  Nickmac11 [1:19 AM]: Exactly  Nickmac11 [1:19 AM]: I can't believe he would do that   Zik495 [1:19 AM]: is there any way he won't be convicted  Nickmac11 [1:19 AM]: I've found the sentences for all the other charges  Nickmac11 [1:19 AM]: He might be able to get off the felony because he technically didn't break in  Zik495 [1:20 AM]: that's what i was thinking  Nickmac11 [1:20 AM]: But he'll definitely get charged with the rest  Nickmac11 [1:20 AM]: Which, so far, his parents are going to have to pay a ton of fines  Zik495 [1:20 AM]: misdemeanors, no jail time?  Nickmac11 [1:20 AM]: Not as far as I've found  Nickmac11 [1:20 AM]: Let's see...  Zik495 [1:20 AM]: phew  Nickmac11 [1:21 AM]: It depends on how much marijuana he had, too  Zik495 [1:21 AM]: he actually had some on him?  Nickmac11 [1:21 AM]: Oooh...  Nickmac11 [1:21 AM]: It depends  Nickmac11 [1:21 AM]: I don't think he did, but he did try some (Idiot)  Nickmac11 [1:22 AM]: Um...actually...  Zik495 [1:22 AM]: i agree  Nickmac11 [1:22 AM]: He could face jail time for the misdemeanors  Zik495 [1:22 AM]: really?  Nickmac11 [1:22 AM]: Yeah  Zik495 [1:22 AM]: uh oh  Zik495 [1:22 AM]: what site are you on?  Nickmac11 [1:23 AM]: Let's see "Purchase or Possession of Alcohol by a Minor- Minors 18 years or younger: Class 1 misdemeanor punishable by imprisonment of 1-45 or fine set at the court's discretion or both  Zik495 [1:23 AM]: 1 to 45 days?  Nickmac11 [1:23 AM]: I'm not on a site...this is stuff I've printed out  Nickmac11 [1:23 AM]: Or a fine  Nickmac11 [1:23 AM]: It depends on the court  Zik495 [1:23 AM]: ah  Nickmac11 [1:23 AM]: I hope it isn't jail time  Nickmac11 [1:24 AM]: He could do a plea bargin type thing  Zik495 [1:24 AM]: me too  Zik495 [1:24 AM]: how so?  Nickmac11 [1:24 AM]: Well...not plea bargin  Nickmac11 [1:24 AM]: But he'll be better off if he just please guilty to what he did  Nickmac11 [1:24 AM]: FAR less likely to get any jail time  Nickmac11 [1:25 AM]: I don't think Andrew will get any jail time  Zik495 [1:25 AM]: good  Nickmac11 [1:25 AM]: He'll have a ton of fines, but he shouldn't go to jail...I don't think  Nickmac11 [1:26 AM]: I don't know...I'm just massively worried about him  Zik495 [1:26 AM]: it just blows my mind. i don't think i'm gonna tell my parents about this.  Nickmac11 [1:26 AM]: He sounded like he realized he had massively fucked up about this  Nickmac11 [1:27 AM]: I can't tell my parents about this...they really liked Andrew  Nickmac11 [1:27 AM]: By the way, I'm very proud of myself for not being too harsh with him  Zik495 [1:28 AM]: you know, sometimes you can do community service to erase a felony from your record. i don't know if it's any felony, but that would be good if he could  Zik495 [1:28 AM]: mmm?  Nickmac11 [1:28 AM]: Yeah, he said they told him he could erase a felony from his record  Nickmac11 [1:28 AM]: When I talked to him...I didn't know if I should be angry...so I tried not to be  Nickmac11 [1:28 AM]: I was more disappointed  Zik495 [1:29 AM]: the police told him that?  Nickmac11 [1:29 AM]: Yeah  Nickmac11 [1:29 AM]: He just didn't remember  Nickmac11 [1:29 AM]: So I was also looking up how to do that  Nickmac11 [1:29 AM]: But can't find it  Zik495 [1:29 AM]: he'll still probably have a criminal record with all those misdemeanors though  Nickmac11 [1:29 AM]: Oh, yeah, definitely  Nickmac11 [1:29 AM]: I mean, he definitely screwed himself over royally  Zik495 [1:30 AM]: yup  Nickmac11 [1:30 AM]: I told him, too, "I know you wanted to be the old Andrew, but this is not the old Andrew. The old Andrew would have NEVER done this."  Nickmac11 [1:31 AM]: And it's especially disappointing after he point blank told me he would never try marijuana  Zik495 [1:31 AM]: too true. i don't know what's happened to him  Nickmac11 [1:31 AM]: I know...and I told him that  Nickmac11 [1:31 AM]: We even had a small fight about me being afraid he would DO SOMETHING LIKE THIS  Zik495 [1:32 AM]: i guess you had him pinned down, unfortunately  Nickmac11 [1:32 AM]: I know  Nickmac11 [1:33 AM]: I'm pretty good at predicting what people will do in a given situation if I know their personality  Nickmac11 [1:33 AM]: And since I know Andrew has resistance problems...well...I figured he would eventually probably do some marijuana  Nickmac11 [1:33 AM]: Never really figured on the breaking in a hotel  Zik495 [1:34 AM]: why would he have even consented to go with them in the first place? or were they drunk already at that point?  Nickmac11 [1:34 AM]: They would have had to been  Nickmac11 [1:35 AM]: I refuse to believe a sober Andrew would have ever agreed to this  Nickmac11 [1:35 AM]: Unless he originally said no and then was pressured into it  Nickmac11 [1:35 AM]: You do not understand, he has HORRIBLE peer pressure problems  Zik495 [1:35 AM]: oh yeah, did he get charged with possession of alcohol? cause if so there goes his license for a year  Nickmac11 [1:35 AM]: Yeah, probably  Zik495 [1:35 AM]: oh i know.  Nickmac11 [1:35 AM]: Damn, that's going to suck  Nickmac11 [1:35 AM]: It's still baffling to me that he would do this  Nickmac11 [1:36 AM]: I told him everything about how worried and disappointed I was  Zik495 [1:36 AM]: peer pressure says it all  Nickmac11 [1:36 AM]: Exactly  Nickmac11 [1:36 AM]: He's so smart and this...this just isn't like him  Zik495 [1:36 AM]: i never thought it'd go as far as this though  Nickmac11 [1:36 AM]: I've been trying to find their mugshots...would they post mugshots for minor  Nickmac11 [1:36 AM]: I know  Zik495 [1:36 AM]: by the way, david hewitt or nolan?  Nickmac11 [1:36 AM]: Nolan  Zik495 [1:37 AM]: that sucks  Nickmac11 [1:37 AM]: I know  Zik495 [1:37 AM]: another strike against our junior class  Nickmac11 [1:37 AM]: Seriously, I can't even express how disappointed I am with him  Zik495 [1:37 AM]: how much you wanna bet that joyce'll know about this one?  Nickmac11 [1:37 AM]: Everyone will know  Nickmac11 [1:37 AM]: The entire school has to know by now  Nickmac11 [1:38 AM]: God, Heidi  Zik495 [1:39 AM]: wow, so i was just clicking on different sites, and i came up with this:  Zik495 [1:39 AM]: "A standard definition of a felony is any crime punishable by more than one year in prison or by death."  Nickmac11 [1:39 AM]: Oh fuck  Nickmac11 [1:40 AM]: Well, what about for a minor?  Nickmac11 [1:40 AM]: Same thing? Like juvenile detention and stuff?  Zik495 [1:40 AM]: i dunno, it hasn't gotten too specific  Nickmac11 [1:41 AM]: God, this is really...I really shouldn't be this worried about him  Zik495 [1:42 AM]: i'm worried too nick  Nickmac11 [1:42 AM]: But this is like...I can't even think straight  Nickmac11 [1:42 AM]: This is like if I was still dating him worried  Nickmac11 [1:42 AM]: (Which, by the way, after tonight, you'd have to convince me pretty hard to stay with him. I fully expect Landon to break up with him)  Zik495 [1:43 AM]: but you can't expect that something that would make you want to break up with him would make you lose all feelings for him  Nickmac11 [1:43 AM]: No, I agree  Nickmac11 [1:43 AM]: But, I'm sorry, this is not a dateable Andrew  Zik495 [1:44 AM]: yeah he fucked up, but you worry even more for him because he actually did so, even as you dislike him for what he did  Nickmac11 [1:44 AM]: I know  Nickmac11 [1:44 AM]: I just...the consequences, too of what he did  Nickmac11 [1:44 AM]: He will get a ton of fines, possible juvenile detention  Nickmac11 [1:44 AM]: He's going to lose a few friends  Zik495 [1:45 AM]: us? i hope not  Nickmac11 [1:45 AM]: Not me, but I know there are going to be some who are going to give up because they're already frustrated with him  Nickmac11 [1:45 AM]: His parents are going to ground him within every inch of his life  Nickmac11 [1:45 AM]: His license is gone  Nickmac11 [1:45 AM]: He's fucked up college and jobs  Nickmac11 [1:46 AM]: Landon will most likely break up with him  Zik495 [1:47 AM]: well, he can still go to college, just maybe not the one he really wanted to, and if that felony is gone it'll be much better, that criminal record will hurt him but hopefully some people will look past it if he doesn't put anything else on it. this is only 17 years of his life. he's got over 50 years to go  Nickmac11 [1:48 AM]: I'm pretty sure he's realized, though, the gravity of the situation  Zik495 [1:48 AM]: yeah it's bad  Nickmac11 [1:48 AM]: Because he sounded really sullen on the phone  Nickmac11 [1:48 AM]: Of course, I also woke him up, so who knows  Nickmac11 [1:48 AM]: I'm just glad he didn't get mad at what I said  Nickmac11 [1:49 AM]: That he was rational and accepted it  Zik495 [1:49 AM]: yeah. you'll have to fill me on your talk that you're having tomorrow  Nickmac11 [1:49 AM]: If he calls me  Nickmac11 [1:50 AM]: I don't know...I just...I promised myself that if he did something stupid while drunk again (*Ahem*) I would talk to him about alcohol problems  Nickmac11 [1:50 AM]: And after this, I really should   Nickmac11 [1:51 AM]: But it's so difficult to approach him about this without him feeling like I'm accusing him or still trying to get back together with him  Zik495 [1:51 AM]: kinda late now  Nickmac11 [1:51 AM]: Well, I know  Nickmac11 [1:51 AM]: But it's just so difficult to criticize him now  Nickmac11 [1:52 AM]: But, you would agree...someone definitely needs to talk to him, right?  Zik495 [1:52 AM]: but, it seems like there might be a chance that he can get the felony reduced to a midemeanor, or at least get the misdemeanor erased from his record if he is convicted. also, maybe his age will help with that. i'm sure that that guy sean, 18 right, will get some jail time  Nickmac11 [1:53 AM]: Sean is 19  Nickmac11 [1:53 AM]: Sean will probably get the worst punishment of the six  Nickmac11 [1:53 AM]: Andrew will probably get the lightest, based off what I've heard  Zik495 [1:53 AM]: yeah  Nickmac11 [1:53 AM]: But, you do agree?  Zik495 [1:53 AM]: and andrew does need to be talked to  Nickmac11 [1:53 AM]: With me talking to him about the alcohol problems?  Nickmac11 [1:53 AM]: Okay  Zik495 [1:54 AM]: i'm just not sure that now is the right time since he's probably killing himself over what happened  Nickmac11 [1:54 AM]: I know  Nickmac11 [1:54 AM]: Well, actually, i think, given that he does feel horrible about what happened, he'd be easier to talk to about it  Nickmac11 [1:54 AM]: He'd be more accepting of criticism  Zik495 [1:55 AM]: but yeah, maybe just tell him that now that he knows what alcohol does, he'll realize that he can't screw around with it cause it'll screw up his life bigtime  Nickmac11 [1:55 AM]: Yeah  Nickmac11 [1:55 AM]: I need to try and find that information I printed out about teen alcohol a few weeks ago  Nickmac11 [1:55 AM]: But...should I suggest he talk to someone?  Zik495 [1:56 AM]: try to get some sleep tonight nick. umm, you mean like a counselor?  Nickmac11 [1:56 AM]: Yeah  Nickmac11 [1:56 AM]: I mean, one person is not going to make a difference  Nickmac11 [1:56 AM]: Especially me  Nickmac11 [1:57 AM]: Ugh  Nickmac11 [1:57 AM]: Yeah, I should go to bed  Zik495 [1:57 AM]: i don't know if he needs that. maybe he does, to strengthen himself against peer pressure  Nickmac11 [1:57 AM]: He does need that BIG TIME  Nickmac11 [1:57 AM]: It's not even peer pressure he absolutely cannot say no  Nickmac11 [1:57 AM]: To anything  Nickmac11 [1:58 AM]: I mean, you heard him when he blew us off for Kill Bill  Zik495 [1:58 AM]: what happened to all those say no DARE things we did in fifth grade?  Nickmac11 [1:58 AM]: I don't know  Nickmac11 [1:59 AM]: God, I don't know how to do this  Nickmac11 [1:59 AM]: I know it'll mean more if his best friend talks to him  Nickmac11 [1:59 AM]: But I still don't know how to do this  Zik495 [1:59 AM]: you'd think they'd get the message across, but i guess not. yeah, saying no is a problem. who'd have thought that it would've gone this far...

I am pathetic. I am the most pathetic human being on Earth right now. I can't get over someone I haven't been dating now for nearly two months. If that's not pathetic, I don't know what is.   *Sigh*   There's so many song Lyrics I want to post. "That Particular Time" by Alanis, "Trouble" by Coldplay...just a lot. I forced myself to listen to some songs that reminded me of Andrew today to see if I could get through them. Let's see...I didn't make it through Such Great Heights, I turned Utopia off, and I started crying in That Particular Time. Oh yes, I am pathetic. I refuse to even attempt Coldplay or "The Luckiest" yet. That would be a disaster.   Three posts in 48 hours. Sheesh. This is how I got addicted to blogs in the first place: I had nothing to do on the weekends and so it was spent reading/updating blogs as that was the most interesting activity.   My weekends are so boring now, and I'm even asking people to do things, just like Andrew said I should do. But no one ever wants to or can do anything. I got invited to Jeremy's party, but...then I'd have to be around Landon, who I'd rather not be around. Besides, the only people I'd be able to talk to there would be Jeremy, Sara and Charlotte, or Jennifer if she went. That's not a lot. So...I just want to DO something. This is exactly what my life was before I started dating Andrew: I stayed home every weekend and was on the computer for hours and slept and did essentially nothing. It was boring as hell. My life is bassically back to the way it was, which I hate.   Do you realize none of this would have ever happened had Landon not been cast in Macbeth? He would have never made friends with Charlotte, who would have then never asked him to do Props for WRF, and then he would have never made friends with Andrew, and then they never would have hung out, and then Andrew never would have gotten a crush on him. So, in a sense, this is all Delaney's fault. I knew that man was hate worthy for a reason.   I kid. Kind of.   I swear it feels like something changed just now. Just, mentally...like I have some sixth sense. I don't know. Not, like, a change in me, but just...all of a sudden...everything seems like maybe it will work out.   I miss Andrew. I want him back.  posted by Nick @ Saturday, May 22, 2004 0 comments  I woke up today and noticed I smelled like Andrew.   Why is this starting to come back?! I was fine, and then, all of a sudden, it's getting back to the way I was the day after we broke up.   I'm listening to "Such Great Heights" which I always related to Andrew. I'm not crying...not yet anyways.    Your Heart is Blue    What Color is Your Heart?  brought to you by Quizilla   I really liked the entry below. Just because it's so true.  posted by Nick @ Saturday, May 22, 2004 0 comments  Friday, May 21, 2004  So...reasons this week sucked:   -Monday. And Tuesday. Not saying I didn't bring some of it on myself, I did, but to just...have to deal with that...it sucked  -The massive juggling act I'm having to do. Work on ROL for a little while, finish The Things They Carried, start planning the LAST MAJOR WORKS DATA SHEET OF JUNIOR YEAR, and research for that US History Project. So, so, SO tired of Junior year  -I think it, it being Andrew and Landon, is finally starting to bother me. Because after reading that note, I'm noticing that Andrew is telling the same things to Landon he used to say to me. And it sucks so much. It's like I'm not used to it. It's like Fred Jones, the part about how "It doesn't look right." I miss Andrew. Not even in a "I want to date you again" sense. I just miss being able to talk to him. We barely do anymore.   I listened to Fred Jones while driving and started sobbing yesterday. And then I made a very, VERY bad mistake of pulling down into the parking lot in my neighborhood to the section we had gone to a couple of times to just sit and talk. And that made it even worse. I was talking with Jesse on the phone last night and the song came on and I started sobbing again. And then I just missed bawling in front of Allison listening to it this morning while driving to school. The part about "Forgotten but not yet gone"...that's what it feels like with Andrew. It's like he's just forgotten about me. And I wish it wasn't like that.   -The Jeremy thing. So, he's just going to have sex with me. But does that mean I still shouldn't do it? If he is going to use me, then I won't be surprised/hurt when he does it. Like Jennifer said, "Then use him right back." But do I really want that? I'm so fucking horny, it's almost sad, and so, at this point, I don't care. But then I think that that would only make it worse because I'll have this brief period to relieve that, and then it becomes even larger. I'm not the pursuer kind of guy. I don't want it to be Hook up with Jeremy and then suffer (heh..."Suffa") for the rest of high school.  -I'm becoming so jealous of Landon, and my hatred of him is only getting bigger. HE got to have sex with Andrew. Andrew gets to tell HIM he wants to spend every second with him. HE gets to be told "I love you." HE GETS ANDREW, FOR FUCK'S SAKE! That's the worst one. And I wish Landon really would stop saying I love you. I think he's confused. I do not doubt that he really likes being around Andrew, but I don't think it's truly love yet. It's like how Andrew and I were for most of December...we really, really enjoyed each other's company more than any other person, but it wasn't until later where we finally knew that it was love. The feelings were had for each other were just indescribeable. A simple "I really, really, really like you" didn't cut it, at least for me.   I don't know. I'm just tired. I'm ready to spend three weeks away from everyone and let them change without my input.   The Jeremy issue...I don't know what I'm going to do.  posted by Nick @ Friday, May 21, 2004 0 comments  Thursday, May 20, 2004  I guess the new purpose of this blog would be to also post stuff I'm not sure if I want Andrew to see.   I really want to be an officer in Thespians next year. I mean...it just...I don't want to be stuck doing the same routine next year. I want some excitement. I'm trying to make Senior year as different from Junior year as possible. I want to take Student Leadership just because I felt so left out of all the stuff they got to do this year and I'd be able to spend some time with Heidi, and Jesse if she gets into it. And whoever else might end up in it. And I want Joyce in a context where I don't want to kill him and I don't feel he thinks I'm a moron.   But, mostly, I just want to be an officer. I'm nominated for Vice President, but it's against Sara, so the chances of me winning are slim to none. The people who show up every week are the people who would vote for Sara. I just don't want to have to deal with the monotony of sitting through meetings again, I want to have more of an involved position...so I'd really like to be an officer. I don't know, Andrew, if you read this, you get to read my egotistical thoughts. Congrats.   I'm really glad I'm Copy Editor of the yearbook next year. That will be different, it won't be the same. I don't want to go through doing the same boring stuff again next year in Yearbook.   Um...what else. I think I am going to switch into Stats AP just because Liz will be in there, plus, I'm already going to have Art History AP, English AP and Biology AP and I really want to take all of those classes. Plus, I want my senior year to be somewhat relaxing, you know?   I can't believe the epiphany I had last night about when Sonny asked me about if Andrew had problems "down there." I just never even thought about the fact that SOMEBODY would have had to tell him that, and I know Andrew wouldn't, and I know I wouldn't, but it never really struck me that Andrew put that on his private blog. And that in order for Sonny to know, either Andrew or Landon had to tell someone. And I know I wouldn't if I were Andrew, so, logically...It's just instances like these that make people either disrespect or hate Andrew, I think. Landon has been telling so much lies and trying to cover them up and I know Andrew doesn't want to believe he is and he shouldn't because of how much he truly likes Landon. But I think that's what's making people not like him. I don't know, if I were Andrew, I would be killing Landon right now. Because Landon had to have told SOMEONE that and, personally, that isn't something you want around the school.   I reread that note he wrote me in Pre-Cal today. The only reason I probably didn't shed a tear or two was because it was Pre-Cal and I don't think that would be good. But it just...I don't know. Something about it. It's the sweetest thing anybody has ever told me and now, after the breakup, it still has the same effect, I guess.   The Love situation...I mean, that's my biggest problem with Landon. I just don't think it's possible to truly love someone in a month and a half, regardless of how much time you spend together. I know Andrew said he doesn't think he loves Landon, and I believe him there, but Landon...I don't know. It's not my place, I know, but I just think that if it happens for them, this tossing around of it right now will only cheapen the weight it carries. To hear someone say "I love you" and know they truly, truly mean it in every aspect...I'll never forget that about Andrew and I.   Actually, I don't think I'd have a problem with Andrew seeing any of this. I'll go post it on my LiveJournal instead.   I feel bad for Andrew. He doesn't deserve this backlash he's getting lately...well, maybe he does, but I only say that because the reasons people are mad at him are the same reasons I was frustrated with him. I think since yelling at him about it, I've definitely cooled off and it seems like we are friends now, so that's nice. It just...I just feel bad that he doesn't see Landon for how he truly is. I mean, I know everyone has to have told him Landon lies about him and the relationship, and, no matter how much you don't want to believe it, there comes a time when you have to realize that not everyone can lie to you about the same subject.   I don't know. I want to do something with Andrew. We haven't in a long time. Like, maybe tomorrow after school or something. Or Saturday, before the Sisterhood party, if there even is one. Or Sunday. Or after school sometime next week. I just want to talk because I feel bad about telling him that a lot of people have either lost respect for him or don't like him anymore.   And I just realized how much it seems like I'm trying to get him to come back to me and break up with Landon, and so my argument is cheapened because of emotions. But that's not what it is. I don't want him to get hurt by Landon, and, with all the lies Landon has been telling and gossip Landon has been spreading (Would you want people around school to know you had trouble getting it up? I don't think so) it just seems like Andrew is just going to get hurt, eventually, and I don't want that to happen to him.  posted by Nick @ Thursday, May 20, 2004 0 comments  I just realized this new template has comments. Huh. Not like it matters as only Andrew this...and I'm not even really sure if he actually reads it or not.   But, cool, Blogger now has comments. These are some pretty radical changes here, El Bloggo  posted by Nick @ Thursday, May 20, 2004 0 comments  Tuesday, May 18, 2004  I want to vomit so much. So fucking much. Landon, that comment...   It's so tough to see the word "love" getting so abused by him. I'm sorry, Landon, you are not in love with Andrew. You can't be. You've only been together for a month and a half. You've had, like, one date, which was a fluke, personally. To have actually known what love is and to see you abusing it so much...it's so hard to not tell you to stop it. If you ever do fall in love with Andrew, real, true, what-I-felt-for-Andrew love, this throwing around of the word love just cheapens it. If your definition of love is "we make out and do sexual stuff a lot" then, by all means, you are COMPLETELY head over heals in love with Andrew. But...no. Right now? You are not in love with Andrew. And Andrew is not in love with you. Somewhere down the road, you may fall in love with him. But, right now, you can't be in love. You absolutely cannot truly LOVE someone in just a month and a half.   So stop saying it (Not that you read this or anything) because when/if it does happen, you're only going to cheapen the true impact of it.   Okay, my rant.  posted by Nick @ Tuesday, May 18, 2004 0 comments  Sunday, May 16, 2004  Damn, I have really updated this blog too much in the past 48 hours.   I'm posting this here in case the draft feature screws up or something-   Year In Review   HA! This school year is too big for me to review. It was a rollercoaster. I've experienced some pretty high highs and some godawful low lows. I fell in love, I experienced a surging hate...it's all so much.   This was supposed to be the hard year. School wise, all the tenth grade teachers say so. Mr. Jackson made English AP out to be so unbelievably difficult. Was there stress? Was there a ton of work? Yes. But I learned this year. My writing has improved drastically, I know more about the history of the United States than I ever needed to know, and, you know, I don't understand most of physics, but I never knew anything about physics before this year except for Newton's laws. I definitely learned this year. Whiteside...to have a teacher who piles on the work but, my god, is so clearly passionate about their subject and obviously wants his students to learn, that's a gift. And that's when you learn. When the teacher's enthusiasm is that evident, the students will therefore become more interested and willing to learn. Major Works Data Sheets suck, there's no way around it. But with some of them, White Noise and The Awakening, specifically, I was trained into how to interpret themes and subjects and discover the subtexts of novels. I can't read anything now with analyzing for style and logic. I just can't. I unwillingly incorporate schemes and tropes in my own writing now. One thing I like about being a junior is that the teachers seem to have some degree of respect for you. We aren't just students anymore; we are almost adults. And while, to some degree, they still have to treat us like students, there isn't such a clear divide as to who is teaching and who is being taught. Instead of it being teacher-student, it becomes almost friend-friend.   As much as I learned academically this year...it's my social life that really changed drastically this year, both good and bad. I've gained a ton of friends this year. It used to be my friends were just limited to my grade. This year has changed that. I've made friends with a ton of sophomores and seniors. Some of my best friends I made this year. Jesse? Jennifer? I knew Jesse briefly last year, but it's this year she became one of my best friends. I've definitely experienced some turmoil this year. My theory was always to keep my mouth shut so no one could hate me. I let go of that this year. Did I cause some people to hate me? Yep. But I didn't care. I was tired of holding back. I'm getting to that point again, too. Sometimes you just can't hold things back, you know? So, yeah, I definitely pissed off a few people this year, but it was resolved. It's going to be so weird being a senior next year. I'll be at the top. This will be the first time I'll have been at the top since fifth grade. That's going to be weird.   I suppose, also, I definitely grew up this year. As cliched as that sounds, in just under six months, I experience so much that I've never experienced before. My first true relationship, love, sex, maintaining friends and a boyfriend, how not to fuck things up, etc. What have I learned from this experience? So much. I know what not to do in my next relationship. I know what will screw it up and I know what will strengthen it. And I can implement it.   Jennifer told me the day after that I would learn who my true friends were through this experience. At first I thought she was just saying stuff to make me feel better. But everything she said was true. As close as I was with people like Heidi, Liz, Jennifer and Jesse before this happened, it was after that they became some of my favorite people. They were there for me. I complained, I sobbed, and they stood by me. They never once complained, they never once told me to shut up and deal with my problems by myself. I couldn't have dealt with this by myself. It would have been too hard. And I have so many people to thank for getting me through it. And should this ever happen to me again (Please don't EVER let it happen to me again) I'm more prepared for what's going to come.   And, of course, as is usual for me, I've only discussed the last two months. The period of time between October 19th and April 5th has, by far, been the happiest time of my life. I fucking fell in love. At the age of seventeen! That doesn't happen to everyone. Some people end up marrying people they don't really love or shouldn't really be with. It's one thing to have fallen in love, it's another to have the person you're in love with fall in love with you too. Do I wish it had lasted? I probably always will. The memories I have of this relationship are too good to ever forget. I wish it would have lasted. But things happen, life throws you curveballs, you deal with them, you adapt. You are my best friend. What you did for me was monumental and I don't think I'll ever be able to repay you for that. I know those two sentiments probably aren't reciprocated, but, for me, it is true. Good luck with your life, with your current boyfriend. You deserve all the happiness in the world.   That's been this year for me. I can think of two quotes to sum it up -- The first would be Mr. Dickens with, "It was the best of times, it was the worst of times." The second, and, by far the most appropriate for this year, would be the main line from The Scientist by Coldplay, "Nobody said it was easy. No one ever said it would be this hard."   I'll never forget Junior year. I never, EVER want to relive it, but this year has changed me in so many ways and that is something worth remembering.  posted by Nick @ Sunday, May 16, 2004 0 comments  I don't want to be bitter. I don't want to be jaded. But the more I talk to Jesse, Jennifer, Jeremy and Sonny, the angrier and more bitter I am becoming.   I guess the best advice I could take right now would be Jeremy's "Don't EVER tell yourself that" but it just won't work. The way I feel about the situation...I don't want to be too melodramatic, but that knife keeps plunging deeper into my heart.   To know who I got traded for...I think that's what hurts the most. And, again, Jeremy even said to never tell myself I got traded. But I can't but feel like I did.   Just...the quotes I've heard from some of these people recently...everything is just getting put into a clear, sharp focus.   I have every reason to be bitter, I don't think that fact is debateable. But I don't want to be.   I want to sit Andrew down and ask him some questions. I'll never get the chance as we never talk anymore except online (Rarely) and I would never ask him these things online.   To Jeremy: Thank you for trying to keep my mood up and trying to keep from feeling like crap  To Jennifer: Thank you for listening to my constant stream of complaints about this  To Jesse: Thank you for being there for me  To Sonny: Thanks for the gossip   I don't want to be bitter. But I think I ultimately am going to be  posted by Nick @ Sunday, May 16, 2004 0 comments  I want to be able to play that piano line from Backdrifts. It's so simple but breathtaking at the same time.   Hell, for all I know it could be a xylophone making that noise.   Tonight...ugh. It just...I just started thinking about all the time I spent the night with Andrew. I hadn't really thought about it before today. But it just hit me like a sack of bricks. For some reason, those times just seemed to show how much I loved him the most. And I miss those. I'd really like to have friends to do something with, but I feel like I'm alone in this. I've depended on Jennifer and Jesse to get me through this too much, and I need to revert and just...I don't know. But, for some reason, I just really started to miss spending the night with him. That's the closest I've come to crying over the fact we're not together anymore since...that train wreck of a day I had the day after we broke up. I wish he had loved me....or at least continued to love me.   God, my life has been so boring this week.  posted by Nick @ Sunday, May 16, 2004 0 comments  Saturday, May 15, 2004  There's just something about this conversation that...it just didn't sit right with me. I think it's because of what Jesse was saying to me earlier and I really wanted to say it to him. And I want his private blog. Because I'm tired of people acting like I'm so emotionally disturbed by Andrew and Landon. I could give a fuck. If Andrew is happier with Landon, fine. Let him be.

       Porcelain    In my dreams I'm dying all the time As I wake its kaleidoscopic mind I never meant to hurt you I never meant to lie So this is goodbye This is goodbye  Tell the truth you never wanted me Tell me  In my dreams I'm jealous all the time As I wake I'm going out of my mind Going out of my mind   -Moby,  Play   It's not very many lyrics, I realize, however, they all seem to relate just to...you know, the topic. And, my God, Play is such a relaxing CD. Really, I love to just listen to it. Porcelain, My Weakness and Why Does My Heart Feel So Bad? are amazing. I've really started to pull out some music I haven't listened to in a while, like The Stone Roses and Fiona Apple and Anuna and Enya and just kind of get back to that mental state I was in before junior year.  Sometimes I really wish he knew what I was going through and he would at least say he's sorry for that

       And i know that i am going to last with him if not forever...then for a really really really long time....But i think it is looking like FOREVER! Haha.    -Landon  Yep, I thought the exact same thing.    I love you so much babe! And I'm never going to let you go!  - Andrew  Yep, you said the exact same thing to me. We'll see if this holds true. If it does, then I'm happy for you two. Honestly.   Is it wrong that I'm still really jealous they get to declare their love for each other publicly? Oh, well.  I still don't know whether or not I want to call Andrew. I probably won't unless I remember the reason WHY I wanted to call him. Something about that comment.

Nickmac11 [12:30 AM]:  I HAVE to send it to you  eriol1213 [12:30 AM]:  :-)  Nickmac11 [12:30 AM]:  You have to see this to believe it  eriol1213 [12:30 AM]:  eriol1214@hotmail.com  eriol1213 [12:30 AM]:  ah yes...  eriol1213 [12:30 AM]:  my masters of prediction are flawless  eriol1213 [12:31 AM]:  i suspected he'd do that...  Nickmac11 [12:31 AM]:  He calls me a hypocrit  eriol1213 [12:31 AM]:  :-)  Nickmac11 [12:31 AM]:  Because I told him to keep out of my lige and get off my case  Nickmac11 [12:31 AM]:  Yet I "am all in his life" and "in his case"  eriol1213 [12:31 AM]:  rofl  Nickmac11 [12:31 AM]:  Which, of course, he isn't  eriol1213 [12:31 AM]:  :-)  Nickmac11 [12:31 AM]:  Just read the damn thing  Nickmac11 [12:32 AM]:  I really want to send back a reply saying "That's your attempt at an apology? Insulting me? Try again"  Nickmac11 [12:32 AM]:  But, of course, then he and Andrew would just think I'm an asshole  Nickmac11 [12:32 AM]:  Because Andrew is deluded  Nickmac11 [12:32 AM]:  But whatever  eriol1213 [12:33 AM]:  omg  eriol1213 [12:33 AM]:  i need air  eriol1213 [12:33 AM]:  my ribs...  eriol1213 [12:33 AM]:  hurting...

      So, I read that conversation with Andrew over again, thinking about what I could say to just smooth things over with him...or not smooth things over, but just let him know that I'll try to either pretend Landon doesn't exist or the two of us somehow work out our problems, which would be my preference, because I really hate having to hate someone so badly that it just...I mean, that whole thing about not knowing what love is? Or just knowing that you're in love? I hate Landon. Love and hate are two very strong words, I realize, but I know that I hate Landon.  And in that conversation, I saw the thing about Hannah, the little dimwit that she is, and I decided to go check her LiveJournal to see if she had made any jabs about me, since, you know, she has before, and what do I find?   I just read Nick's blog, and I don't feel bad saying I laughed...I laughed a whole lot. Let's be a little bit MORE dramatic. Things change, we all survive.   How tempting it was to leave a comment saying "Wow, Hannah, I laugh when I read your blog all the time, too! But it's really just over how stupid you are" but that's not something I would do. Besides, I don't know Hannah! And she doesn't know me! The little idiot. Furthermore, that comment was made on July 2nd, meaning...I WAS OVER IT AT THAT POINT! At that point, I had REALIZED that things change and that I'd be okay with that. God, she's just as stupid as Landon; as immature, too.  Seriously now, I'm TIRED of this. I think I'm just going to tell Andrew to really tell her to back off as she doesn't know me. I want nothing to do with her at all. She has no right to impose on me at all -- SHE DOESN'T FUCKING KNOW ME! All she's getting is Landon's version, which, of course, makes Landon look like a Saint and me look like Satan. It doesn't help that Andrew's probably had to insult me a couple of times in front of her because Landon's present.  Ugh. I shouldn't hate two people at the same time, but I really, really do.

      So Andrew and I are talking again. We're friends! That's...weird, actually. Actually, you know, I'm gettinf frustrated with talking to him because we always have to talk about Landon, and I understand that it's going to be tough to be friends when Landon doesn't want him to like me and that Andrew wants Landon and I to make up so we can be friends, but...Andrew is so stubborn. Or not stubborn, because that has negative connotations. But it's just...I flat out told him that I will not apoligize to Landon after he spread my private blog. Actually, here's the conversation:   Nickmac11 [12:28 PM]: Um, I hope I didn't seem rude last night. I would have said hi or something, but I didn't want to put you in a position where Landon would have gotten mad at you or anything Andy2343N [12:29 PM]: i guess i understand. it did kind of seem hard to get even one of you to look at me, but...like i said, i understand *EDIT Andy2343N [12:39 PM]: you didn't give him any sort of a look yesterday, did you? Nickmac11 [12:39 PM]: Nope Nickmac11 [12:39 PM]: I flat out ignored him yesterday Nickmac11 [12:39 PM]: Did he say I did? Andy2343N [12:39 PM]: yes Nickmac11 [12:39 PM]: Liar Andy2343N [12:40 PM]: well i kind of thought that maybe he was just imagining it Nickmac11 [12:40 PM]: He was Andy2343N [12:40 PM]: okay Andy2343N [12:40 PM]: um, you never really responded to what i had said about him in my e-mail Nickmac11 [12:40 PM]: Apoligizing? Nickmac11 [12:40 PM]: After he spread my private blog? Nickmac11 [12:40 PM]: A snowball has a better chance in hell Nickmac11 [12:41 PM]: Before I found that out, I might have considered it, and that's what I wanted to talk to you about Andy2343N [12:41 PM]: do you think you could be civil, it's not like you are completely faultless either Nickmac11 [12:41 PM]: I'm not saying I'm completely faultless Nickmac11 [12:42 PM]: But I don't feel like apoligizing to someone who has done something like that Andy2343N [12:42 PM]: okay, that's fine Andy2343N [12:42 PM]: i'm asking you to be civil Nickmac11 [12:42 PM]: I am Andy2343N [12:42 PM]: even when you're not talking to me about him, because if you're not that obviously means you're still mad which is going to make it hard to be civil Andy2343N [12:42 PM]: in my opinio Andy2343N [12:42 PM]: n Nickmac11 [12:43 PM]: So...you're saying that I should just shut up about him with other people? Nickmac11 [12:43 PM]: Tell him to do the same about me Andy2343N [12:43 PM]: i ma Andy2343N [12:43 PM]: am Nickmac11 [12:43 PM]: Because I'm tired of getting these jabs at me on his LiveJournal Nickmac11 [12:43 PM]: And tell Hannah to go get a life. She doesn't even know me Andy2343N [12:43 PM]: he's tired of the same Andy2343N [12:43 PM]: i know Nickmac11 [12:43 PM]: I don't make jabs at him Nickmac11 [12:44 PM]: Maybe on my private blog, but that was because I didn't know anyone had it Andy2343N [12:44 PM]: i asked him what he was talking about the other day...and i' ve kind of forgotten now Nickmac11 [12:44 PM]: Ha ha ha Andy2343N [12:44 PM]: i just don't want it to always be like this Andy2343N [12:44 PM]: both of you hating each other Andy2343N [12:45 PM]: and i'm trying very hard to get him to just get over everything Nickmac11 [12:45 PM]: I don't want to sound pessimistic, but I think Landon and I have pretty much irreconcilable differences Andy2343N [12:45 PM]: but, it's just kind of tricky with him Nickmac11 [12:45 PM]: I'm sure he's still convinced I hate him because he's dating you, right? Andy2343N [12:45 PM]: fine, but do you seriously want to be mad at a person forever? Nickmac11 [12:45 PM]: No Nickmac11 [12:45 PM]: I just ignore him Andy2343N [12:46 PM]: yeah, i guess that is the besdt Andy2343N [12:46 PM]: best Nickmac11 [12:46 PM]: That and that I'll never have to be around him in one year Andy2343N [12:46 PM]: hmm? Andy2343N [12:46 PM]: oh Nickmac11 [12:46 PM]: I mean...I feel like I'm being really mean here Nickmac11 [12:47 PM]: But...it's going to take some apoligizing on his part too  Andy2343N [12:47 PM]: i don't know, i just want to take the both of you and through you guys in a room together and just let you talk, or fight it out, or whatever needs to be done Nickmac11 [12:47 PM]: AH! Nickmac11 [12:47 PM]: I've actually wanted someone to do that! Nickmac11 [12:47 PM]: Seriously! Nickmac11 [12:48 PM]: Of course, I also said one of us would probably die in the process, but...  And then he had to go eat. So...Who knows. I'm glad he did suggest the throwing us in a room and letting us fight it out. That'd be my preference. I don't know. I guess we'll talk it out some more later or something. Who knows.  AGH! I still have that damned crush on Sonny! Go away! Now! Or please let Brandon and Sonny break up! I know it's bad to wish that upon them, but...ugh.

      So, here is the new private blog. Only Jesse gets it this time. I would be fine with Andrew having it, well, that is, if he truly didn't give it out, but still, Landon would have had to get it through Andrew's computer and I really don't want that. Anyways.  Guess that's about it.   I might be able to use pictures. I guess we'll find out

      I'm talking to Jesse right now.  She apparently had some conversation with Charlotte where Charlotte essentially said she's glad she graduated so she can make a clean break from Landon. Can't say I blame her, or anyone, for that matter, for wanting to get away from Landon. She also apparently said that she doesn't believe Andrew and Landon are in love, they just write love letters to each other on their blogs and have sex and they don't act like a couple at all. And that Landon and Hannah are stupid. And that all three of them "lost major points in her book" after the whole Jesse blog debachle (Debacle? Who cares, really.) It's just...telling...that of all people, CHARLOTTE feels that way towards the two of them.  I really want to know what people thought of me and Andrew as a couple so I can tell if there's anything I should work on for my next relationship. All I know so far is that Jesse thinks that "It was the cutest thing I've ever seen" and Jeremy said "You and Andrew were an awesome couple." Now, I didn't ask Jeremy or Jesse specifically, so I guess I might have to get people's opinions inadvertantly. I mean, it would seem really...weird if all of a sudden I just IMed someone and said "What did you think of me and Andrew?" It would also seem like I'm not over him, and I know in my heart that I'm over him (That sounds really cliched, but it's true)  Okay, the purpose of this entry WAS going to create the updated list of my Fucking Awesome songs, and I got off track.

This conversation with Jesse is making me very contemplative.  It's amazing. Yeah, I'm over Andrew, but, at night, when I'm lying alone, I get so nostalgic for when he used to spend the night. That's the only time I think of him anymore.

      I've been dreaming a lot lately. I think the stress of the drama and the lack of sleep is starting to send me over the deep end. I've had dreams about Mel Gibson in a skintight unitard in a space ship (Don't ask, I don't know) and my dad holding a garage sale during december (I distinctly remember seeing the Christmas tree being set up and thinking "They didn't ask me to help decorate!") and deciding which of my belongings he was selling, and he took my favorite belonging (It was a dragon. I don't even have a dragon...it was fake, by the way) and would not give it back, and other really cool, interesting stuff.  But there were two dreams I have recently that I want to share in detail, because I want to:  Okay, the first one. It has to do with Chris, who, sadly, I really need to get over. It only makes matters worse that Lauren Hurst wants to do something with Chris, me and Katie as we were like the two Dynamic Duos of the trip (She and Chris, me and Katie. We always sat together on the bus, plane, eating, etc.) and I really probably should never, ever see him again. Anyways, so, in the dream, Chris just invited us all to his house. So, while he's outside, I run inside into his room, and pick up a white t-shirt that he had worn or something, and smell it. And I remember thinking "This smells like Andrew." It just worries me that the only reason I might have this massive crush on Chris is because he reminds me of Andrew. Jesse told me to not think of it that way, and I think I've actually started to realize that the only thing they have in common is that they are both very intelligent and very funny. Chris is more one liner type humor than Andrew's all around craziness. Plus, Chris is smart and goes for it. Andrew is smart, but backs out (English AP, anyone?) and doesn't go for it. So, really, there's only two similarities. However, getting back to the dream, I took the shirt with me. And it scared me, because in the dream, I remember going "I can smell this to think of him." And, my God, whenever Andrew left after the spending the night at my house, I smelled the area in my bed where he had slept, I smelled my shirt where his arm had been around me or where my chest had been pressed to his back. Even that "novel" he wrote me I kept smelling to get his smell. And it scared me because, again, another similarity. But, like Jesse said, I've started looking at it as what they don't have in common, and while, on the surface, they may seem very similar, when you actually get down to it, they're very different.  Moving on the second, awesome-yet-disturbing dream.  Landon died. I kid you not. I was at a garage sale, and someone told me that Landon died, I think it was Diana. So, anyways, Andrew shows up, and is looking around and I say to him, "Did you know Landon died?" And he simply replies with a pretty bland, "Yeah," as if he was saying "Yeah, thank GOD." So Andrew looks like he completely doesn't care. So I get on the computer and go to IMDb (Apparently, in this dream world, Landon was a celebrity who had been in a movie big enough to warrant him his own page on IMDb) to check how he died as IMDb tells how celebrities died. Get this: He was skateboarding, fell, and hit his head and died. ANd he also had been smoking some "chicken weed." Don't ask. It was weird.  I'm really fascinated by the dream state. Like, what DO our dreams mean, you know? It can't always be about events that happened in the day (Although the preceding two dreams both occured after I read that idiotic thing Landon posted and I told Jesse how I was scared that maybe the only reason I had a crush on Chris was because he reminded me of Andrew). I've heard that if you go to sleep trying not to think of something, you'll end up dreaming about it, because your subconcious brings it up. Ah, who knows. But the dream state really fascinates me. I think I'm going to start writing down my dreams more often; I like to remember them.

      Okay, so. Well, I'm furious. I read that damned entry and I was literally shaking I was so mad. And everytime I reread it, I get angrier and angrier. I can't stand this! Who the FUCK does he think he is! First of all, he's an idiot for making a private blog directly linked to his blog through the "andrew tate" interest. And as if that weren't idiotic enough, he doesn't even make the entries private! That's what I would do because LiveJournals are too public! MORON! IDIOT! ASSHOLE!  AND THEN! I love how he "knows" the I'm trying to get back with Andrew. Get over it, Landon. I'm over him. What we had has been over for so long now. And what's the SHIT about it being "nick-ey"? I never tried to tell him who he could and couldn't talk to. ASSHOLE. How dare you make that generalization! Actually, wait, you're so STUPID you probably don't know what that means. But, of course, godforbid I ever be over Andrew in your mind. I swear, I could ask him for so much as a piece of paper and your mind would be thinking (I'll write this as if I was you to help you understand it) "Ooo, i think nick is probly thhinking, andrew gave me thhis pappeer, thhaat musst meen hes saying tha he wants tooo tri agin" Fuck you, Landon. Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you. I have moved on with my life. I fucking apoligized to you! You mean just as much to me as little bug, meaning, if I were ever to get the chance to step all over you, I would do it. And I would laugh. When Andrew dumps you (Note: When), I will point in your face and laugh. And I will feel so fucking good about it, you have no clue. And then I'll simply say "SEE?!" at the end of the year when I haven't made any move to get Andrew back. GET OVER IT, LANDON! If you hate me so much, why do you devote so much time to bashing me? WOuldn't you just move on? I don't do it to you, you know. Sure I make snide comments about you, but I don't devote entire ENTRIES to saying how much I hate you, and believe me, my hatred for you spans over a great, GREAT distance. Why can't you just fucking let it go?! If I wanted to try to get Andrew back, let me! That's my own fall I'd be setting myself up for. Besides, you know Andrew wouldn't come back to me, so why should it bother you? Shouldn't you wish ill will for me? So perhaps what you're really saying here is that you don't trust Andrew not to dump you for me. Oh, that would be poetic justice. Just like I got dumped for you, how sweet it would be to have him dump you for me. It still baffles me that you're so fucking concerned about it. GET A LIFE! You hate me, you love Andrew, blah blah blah. ALRIGHT! WE GET IT! Must you post about it EVERY SINGLE ENTRY?! It's like you're battering us with a stick to make sure we know that you love Andrew and that I'm an asshole!  Landon, you have no idea what amount of psychological torment I'm prepared to give you next year. You welcomed it upon yourself, and I will be only happy to fulfill.  It's strange, I know that you can find my new private blog if you saved my profile on Blogger. I really, really hope that people still have this.  Fuck you, Landon. I apoligized, but apparently that wasn't enough. Apparently it was all a lie that you accepted my apology. But that's okay, I never accepted yours, either. I'll save that rant for another day.  In the meantime: Andrew calls me mean? Is he really that deluded?
