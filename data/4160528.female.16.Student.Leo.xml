Adjust the tint on your tv so that all the people are green, and insist to others that you "like it that way".  Drum on every available surface.  Sing the Batman theme incessantly.  Staple papers in the middle of the page.  Hide dairy products in inaccessible places.  Specify that your drive-through order is "to go".  Publicly investigate just how slowly you can make a "croaking" noise.  Honk and wave to strangers.  Dress only in clothes colored Hunter's Orange.  Decline to be seated at a restaurant, and simply eat their complimentary mints by the cash register.  Begin all your sentences with "ooh la la!"  Pay for your dinner with pennies.  Repeat everything someone says, as a question.  Write "X - BURIED TREASURE" in random spots on all of someone's roadmaps.  Wander around the restaurant, asking other diners for their parsley.  At the laundromat, use one dryer for each of your socks.  Leave your turn signal on for fifty miles.  Lick the filling out of all the Oreos, and place the cookie parts back in the tray.  Routinely handcuff yourself to furniture, informing the curious that you don't want to fall off "in case the big one comes".  Follow a few paces behind someone, spraying everything they touch with a can of Lysol.  While making presentations, occasionally bob your head like a parakeet.  Lie obviously about trivial things such as the time of day.  Make beeping noises when a large person backs up.  Leave your Christmas lights up and lit until September.  Change your name to John Aaaaasmith for the great glory of being first in the phone book. Claim it's a Hawaiian name, and demand that people pronounce each A.  Sit in your front yard pointing a hair dryer at passing cars to see if they slow down.  Chew on pens that you've borrowed.  Invent nonsense computer jargon in conversations, and see if people play along to avoid the appearance of ignorance.  Sing along at the opera.  At a golf tournament, chant "swing-batatatatatata-suhWING-batter!"  Ask the waitress for an extra seat for your "imaginary friend".  Select the same song on the jukebox fifty times.  Do not add any inflection to the end of your sentences, producing awkward silences with the impression that you'll be saying more any moment.  Never make eye contact.  Never break eye contact.  Signal that a conversation is over by clamping your hands over your ears.  Forward e-mails back to the person that sent it to you.

See my halo, nice and shiney Mess with me, I'll kick ur hiney  I can find anyone to hold me, but what I need now is for u to love me  Hott guys open my eyes, Smart guys open my mind, but only sweet guys open my heart  The worst way to miss someone is when they are right beside you, yet you can't have them  Basically don't stress me, u can't impress me, I ain't a tease, Just a reminder of what u can't please  The first time I saw you, I knew it was true, that I'd love you forever, and that's what I'll do. You don't know what you do to me, you don't have a clue. You don't know what it's like looking at you.  *SoMeDaY YoU WiLl Be SoRrY, SoMeDaY WhEn YoU'rE FrEe, MeMoRiEs WiLl ReMiNd YoU, ThAt We WeRe MeAnT To Be*  Meeting you was fate,Be coming ur friend was a choice, but falling in love with u was beyond my control  *Friends last forever, but Boyfriends only last you so long!*  Kisses spread germs and germs are hated.....so kiss me baby!! I'm vacinated!!!!!!!!!  "Men kick friendship around like a football and it doesn't seem to crack. Women treat it like glass and it falls to pieces"  You can make more friends in two months by becoming interested in people, than you can in two years by trying to get people interested in you.   Its not as if Im hard to please, Ur the only one good enuff for me,Those others just won't do, i don't like anyone but U!!  I cry for the time that U were almost mine, I cry 4 the memories I've left behind, I cry for the pain, the lost, the old the new, I cry for the times I thought I had you  At first, I cried beacause I didn't have you...why do I still cry now that I do?  *Everyone has a life lesson to learn..some of us have already learned ours..and others will in time!*  Sugar is sweet but it rots your teeth The ocean is Calming till it sucks you beneath I thought you loved me, but you too hurt me  Friends are like elevator buttons, they can either take you up or bring you down, choose wisely.  I'm not a lie, I'm not an illusion, I'm a princess so what's the confusion?  You know my heart is going to cry, if you leave me lonely, cause your not just my love you're my hommie  I look at the moon and a single star It's making me crazy wondering where you are I reach out and touch that heavenly face Open my hand and there's empty space  in some cultures what i do iz considered normal  friends are like starz, u don't always see them but they r always there  if barbie is so popular....then y do u have 2 buy her friends?

Madness chases some, but waits for others...  Wanting him is hard to get. Loving him is hard to regret. Losing him is hard to accept. But with all the hurt I've felt, letting go is the most painful yet.  Even if the voices are not real, they have some good ideas.  True friends, like diamonds, are precious and rare. False friends, like autumn leaves, are found everywhere  FaItH Is bEliEviNg In tHiNgs WheN cOmMon sEnSe TelLs yOu nOT To!!!  iF u sAy i cAnT u wOnT, iF u sAy i qUiT u lOsE, iF u sAy i'Ll tRy u mIgHt jUsT wIn bUt u hAvE tHe pOwEr tO cHoOsE  angels are supposed to be good....so y did one break my heart?

Intelligence is like a river. The deeper it is, the less noise it makes. Wit a X n' a O im out lyke whoa  u can say u love me but until u prove it the words mean nothing 2 me.  a broken heart continues to beat..  A girl and a guy can be just friends, but at one point or another they will fall for each other..Maybe temporarily, maybe at the wrong time, maybe too late, or maybe forever...  The first time I saw you, I knew it was true~That I'd love you forever and that's what I'll do~You don't know what you do to me~You don't have a clue~You don't know what it's like to be me lookin @ you!!  guys are like a peice of gum, when they loose there flavor, you pop in a new one*~*  °i Do BeLeiVe DaT GoD aBoVe° °CrEaTeD Me FoR Ya To LuV° °He PiKeD Ya OuT MoNg Da ReSt° °CuZ He KnOs iD LuV Ya Da BeSt°  If U Want Me To Fall 4 U...

One moment you will be happy, One moment you will be blue. .  If you get a chance to see him, Your heart begins to dance. Your life revolves around him, There's nothing like romance  You might regret what you do- but you'll you regret what you don't do SO much more  You're only bad if you're caught... So that makes me a good girl, RIGHT!?  As part of you has grown in me, together forever shall we be, never apart maybe in distance but not in heart.  When in LOVE: be fair and honest, even when it hurts.  let them notice you, not you notice them  I believe in angels, the kind that heaven sends. I'm surrounded by angels, but I call them my best friends.  I'll Try Anything Once, Twice If I Like It!  To Say That You Can Love One Person All Your Life, Is Like Saying That One Candle Will Continue To Burn For As Long As You Live  The oposite sex is the most dangerous and addictive drug out there, but the high is unlike anything else  If you love someone that means you have a good heart. If someone loves you thats flattering. If your love someone and they love you back thats special!  Mystify people with your intelligence, and if u cant do that, mystify them with your B.S.  Yesterday is history, tomorrow is a mystery, today is a gift, that is why we call it the present!  *Once Upon a Time* *Something Happened To me* *It was the Sweetest Thing* *That ever could be* *It was a Fantasy* *A dream Come True* *It was the Day i Met You*  ~If you're waiting for tomorrow, why not do it today? For if tomorrow never comes, you'll surely regret this day.~  The face is the mirror of the mind, and eyes without speaking confess the secrets of the heart.  I don't want you to love me i don't want you to care i don't want you wishing that i was there SO If you really love and you do truly care than stop spending nights wishing i was there  If u WaNnA gEt wiTh mE iN Mi GiRlz uLL hAvE fUn i BeT, bUt I mUsT WaRn yA, WeRe LiTtLe pLaYeTtS  *U broke my heart and made me cry..

       Have you ever wondered which hurts the most? Saying something and wishing you hadn't or Saying nothing and wishing you had?  I guess the most important things are the hardest things to say.Don't be afraid to tell someone you love them. If you do, they might break your heart...if you don't, you might break theirs.  Have you ever decided not to become a couple because you were so afraid of losing what you already had with that person?  Your heart decides whom it likes and whom it doesn't. ou can't tell your heart what to do. It does it on its own........when you least suspect it, or even when you don't want it to.  Have you ever wanted to love someone with everything you had, but that other person was too afraid to let you?  Too many of us stay walled up because we are too afraid to care too much...for fear that the other person does not care as much, or even at all.  Have you ever denied your feelings for someone because your fear of rejection was too hard to handle?  We tell lies when we are afraid... afraid of what we don't know, afraid of what others will think, afraid of what will be found out about us.  But every time we tell a lie, the thing we fear grows stronger.  Life is all about risks and it requires you to jump.  Don't be a person who has to look back and wonder what they would have done, or could have had.  * What would you do if every time you fell in love you had to say good-bye?  *What would you do if every time you wanted someone they would never be there?  *What would you do if your best friend died tomorrow and you never got to tell them how you felt? (even if it is that you don't care anymore)  *What would you do if you loved someone more than ever and you couldn't have them?  *What would you do if you never got the chance to say I am friends with all of my family and they know I love them?*  I need a real man who kno how 2 treat a ladii .. the type who dont act shadii and wen his boyz ask he says .. yea dat my babii  I waS thE 1 He GaVe ThE StReEt LyFe Up Fo,Who MaDe HiM hAnG HiS jErSEe On Da BAck OF tHa dO', ANd saYd" fuCk IT i dONt waNNa bE a PLaYA nO mO"  I  Be ThA GuRl He CaLL hIs BaBy..
