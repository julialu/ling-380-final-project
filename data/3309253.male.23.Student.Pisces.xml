      Hi all,  Sadly (happily?), Gaurav got an internship in a siicon valley netowrks company and will have loads  of paperwork to do, so will not join us for the trip : - (.   We will miss you Gaurav!  Anyways, Hiten is final to go and tomorrow morning, Sumit (my officemate) is going to drive us to the National Car rental office at the LA airport.  For those of you who think I am crazy in posting my friends' names without givings background info, I am doing this purposefully - I want you to form a picture of them as you read through my exploits :D  Anyways, my grades for Spring 2004 are out and I did well :-)  Cya later people..... Animesh P.S. for those of you who do not know, India, the world's largest democracy with more than a billion people had its national general elections some time ago and the results were out for the entire parliament within 6 hrs of the starting of counting!!! Kudos to electronic voting!!

      No, we are not planning to dig deep underneath in an Osiris-esque ship to reach the human settlement of the future (or is this future already the present?.. are we actually in the MATRIX?.. well, that's a later post).  This is not the matrix.  This is the United States, and we are going for a road trip.  From May 15th to May 20th, Sam, Sameer, Gaurav and yours truly (is Hiten also Coming?) , a gang of  desi  (what Indians in the US call themselves) grad students, are going for a trip to the  urlLink Zion National Park  in Utah and  urlLink Lake Havasu City  in Arizona.  So, what does this mean for you, the reader?  This means a lot of  photographs  which I will have to share once we are over with the trip. We are really excited about this and have bought a tent and a propane stove also. Sameer can't stop thinking about the Buick he will get to drive :D.  Well then, back to work.... Cheers -A
