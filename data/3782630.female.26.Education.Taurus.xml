      Ah, the new year at Camptoons.  The counselors are all hard at work, or are they?  Some of them spend an awful lot of time online.  I wonder what they do while they're in the office?  Let's take a peek.  Aha!  Take a look at the picture below.  Is this counselor hard at work, or is there something fishy going on here?  Maybe you should ask her.

      There's fozzie, peachy, I mean, peach, uhh... squid, squirt, bert...no, no bert, uhh... road runner, two-tone, toru, or is it fofu, uhh... rats, just too many names to remember.  Anyway, welcome to Camptoons 2k4.  Training began, staff has gathered, there is an air of expectancy, or is that the aroma of feet?  Whatever, it looks like a great start to some exciting weeks ahead.  Some of things I learned is that you can do so much stuff with a bell, a horseshoe, a napkin and a big roll of tape :o) - ask the gang, they'll have you rolling.  Especially what Clark, I mean Odie, did.  Happy camping!! The hEaD has spoken.

      So you're done and heading off to college or high school, well not immediately, but you're done.  After all the pictures, after all the yearbook autographs, after the dinners, the oohs and ahhs, the I'll miss you's, love you's, remember you's, whatever you's.  Proud parents, obligatory appearances by distant relatives, bored siblings and cousins.  The lights are off, the music is finished, one last dance?  So what?  Now what?  In the heady moments of your supreme accomplishments.  In this time of self absorption when you stand up and stand out remember these words:  For by the grace given me I say to everyone of you:  Do not think of yourself more highly than you ought, but rather think of yourself with sober judgment, in accordance with the measure of faith God has given you...Bless those who persecute you; bless and do not curse.  Rejoice with those who rejoice; mourn with those who mourn.  Live in harmony with one another.  Do not be proud, but be willing to associate with people of low position.  Do not be conceited. (Rom. 12:3,14-16 NIV)  Hang around anyone of low position lately?  Jesus did it all the time.

      Well, it's that time of year again. Graduation. Friends going to a different school and some to the same school.  You may not see some of them again.  As a teacher, it's so hard to see some of them leave especially those that really need Jesus in their lives.  We can only try to reach them, one at a time without getting in trouble but we still need to watch out how we present it to the student.  So JSers and AKers, it's up to you to reach out to your friends.  This is where we need your help.  You can talk to your friends freely about God but teachers can't. So take that chance to talk to your friends before they're gone.  Not sure how, invite them to fellowship and we'll help you.  Congratulations to all you Graduates in JS and AK.

      so you're diving into a new web site, or diving into a new book (are you guys still reading?), or diving into a new movie - are you looking for a new experience or are you looking to broaden your perspective?  I mean, is the priority to feel something new, or to learn something different?  Are you more interested in feeling or learning?  Or are the two inseparable?  Is this too much to think about?  Your head swelling?  Now you know how I feel hee hee

      Here I sit watching the news of President Reagan's death.  The passing of someone famous allows us to think about the frailty of human bodies and the limited length of human life.  Yet as one life (amongst many) ends, others are experiencing a wonderful transition (GO '04!).  Regardless of the situation, it is always good to remember the nearness of our Lord God and His care and delight in us.  May our focus be ever heavenward.

      Hey All.  Here we are gathered around the big giant hEaD thinking thots and trying to decide what to write.  This blog will be for all the staff to show something of themselves so that you can get to know more of them.  Stay tuned for some great stuff - the fat hEaD will meet often to think and talk about Jesus and us and especially you.  Till then - ta ta for now :o)

      Camp, camp, camp, Mexico, camp  Here, there, and back again  What did we see?  What have we experienced thus far?  The nearness of God, our total insufficiency, how easy we sin, how good Jesus is, how hard it is to get along, how easy it is to misunderstand -- and over all the incredible grace of our Lord Jesus who continues to visit us and walk alongside of us.   How's that for a crazy adventure?  May it never end.

      Wow, what a day!  Never had so much problems to deal with in one day at CampToons.  It's going to take awhile for some to let it go but with God's love we can do it.  Let's put this all behind us and start all over.  It's a brand new day where we can start fresh.  "May the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be pleasing to You." Psalm 19:14  So difficult to lecture everyone but when it needs to be done, it needs to done.  I hate doing it because it makes me sad to see everyone feeling bad.  Remember we're doing this for the Lord.  We're all serving for the same purpose. This is what makes CampToons so different and unique from many other camps.

      Well, I can't believe we're almost half way through CampToons.  Hope everyone got some rest during the 3 day weekend.  Seems like everyone is getting tired and sick faster this year than before and it's only been 2 weeks.  4 more weeks to go.  Remember to look towards God for strength each day.  Don't rely on your own strength. We are weak, God is strong. So pray for each other and for those going on the Mexico trip next week.

      Ever have one of those "duuuhhhh" moments (emphasis on the drawn out uuuhhhh)where the obvious wasn't so obvious until someone pointed it out?  Well the Camptoons directors and others have decided to count all the duuuhhh moments that we have and the winner gets to do something the others decide.  Thus far the point counts are Zazu, Daisy and Furball with one each, but leading the pack - way, way, waaaaayyy, ahead is Peach with a whopping 3 (count them) duuuuhhhh moments.  It looks like her lead is insurmountable, so expect some zany act come friday.  GO PEACH!!!!!!
