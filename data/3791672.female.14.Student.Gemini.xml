       This is to the coolest bestes person i have ever known, Kayla. Kayla I am sooo sorry for what i have done. When i recently saw you in florida I admit i...avoided you. I just didnt feel like hanging out with you. So the whole week went by and knowing we used to be good friends, i didnt even say hi to you at all. But you seemed to look different this time i saw you.   I had no idea that unmentionable things would happen to you, things tht would cange your life, FOREVER! When you went back to your home town you found out you have a brain tumor in your head, but the aweful thing is, you only had 6 more months to live. By the time i am writing this i think you have left us already.   I am sooo sorry i never played with you or anything for that last precious week we had to see eachother. I never knew but it shouldnt have made a difference if you were sick or not. I will always remember you as a friend and will never ever forget you! You were my super cool best friend.  I give you my appologies, and please dont be in pain, live the rest of your life being happy, i know you will never get to marry, or have kids or grandkids or even see me again, you will never travel or experience new and interesting things, but try to live your life as much as you can and remember I WILL REMEMBER YOU (now i am crying)  Kayla i wrote a poem for you but i dont wont to write it out loud, i dont think i have ever told anyone aboutthis but i want everyone to know that you dont aviod anyone if you dont feel like it because you know what happened to kayla, use your time wisely you nver know what could happen to someone when you least expect it. Like everytime i say good bye to my mom or dad i always wave and say i love you, even to my aunts and uncles and even hugs and kisses too, just to show then how muc hi love them if i never got to see them again.  This article is for you Kayla, May you RIP and wait for me in heaven, and make sure you watch over me! Love you Kayla, P.S Cant wait to see what's up there, tell me sometime, Ashley. (dont mind me crying, i just feel bad)
