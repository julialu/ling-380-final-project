      This is a set of experimental photos that I took last night. They're all at home, and each one has something special. Oh and I think I figured  out how I messed up the order of one of the pictures in the last few sets. When I uploaded my last picture with Hello I didn't refresh blogger and then post the summary so the last picture ended up before the summary. I did it again only this time it was fixable since the last one required deleting and re-posting 7 pictures to fix, and this one didn't. Not that you care about this anyways...

      I also upped the brightness on this one, and took a picture of the faucet at an odd angle.  urlLink

      I played around with the brightness for this picture. It makes the boring nearly white walls a little more interesting.  urlLink

      It's just a light switch, I know. I'm experimenting with lighting. It's hard to make boring objects cool. Other people photograph switches really well.  urlLink

      Here is the series of b&w pictures I said I'd make of the rejects from Canada Day. Some look pretty cool. There's still one of one of the buildings that I loathe though. Otherwise, still pretty good. Oh by the way, the lamp at the bottom of this set is part of the previous set but somehow I'm dumb enough to mess that up... hehe...

      This set of pictures was taken on Canada Day in Downtown Vancouver. I took many pictures but these were my favorites. I like most of these because of the beautiful colors. The others were just dull... I might make b&w versions then... It's a thought. Anyways, enjoy!

      Ok, 10 pictures uploaded today. They're not that good. I used a low resolution for them so the quality sucks. For future pictures I'll do high resolution. Nothing really special yet. But I like the picture of the playground and the grey sky. That's about it. Comments?

      The collection posted today is one of mixed subjects. I was too lazy to upload the pictures at the time so they collected on my computer and I had to upload them some day. They include pictures of my fencing club at Discover Days at the Shadbolt Center for the Arts, as well as&nbsp; pictures at Lake Cheakamus,&nbsp; a few in the city on the way home, and one random one taken for no special reason. Well there is a reason. But it wasn't planned. It was amusing.

      Another bear. This little (big) guy got himself caught in a bear trap right when we were getting in our car in the parking lot. They're relocating bears from the Whistler area because they're getting numerous (I saw 3 that day) and dangerous. I wish I could have gotten a better shot. You can't see the bear in this picture. I was afraid that it would go mad if I turned on the flash. Oh well... The memories...  urlLink

      Black bear! Well actually this one is brown. I nearly walked into it because I was getting ahead of the group hiking back to the car. It was so freaking close to me! I back tracked and then ran for it. When I came back with the rest of the group I took this picture. The bear was far away then.  urlLink
