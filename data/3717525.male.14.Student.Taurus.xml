      time: 2245  aaaaaaahh!! wad to do? i feel like pon(ing) mass jog tomorrow but got attendence and such reasons holding me back... i skipped cca too many times, and got dumb project to do, and another one more important too. haiz, so busy sia. but after tat can slack 1 dae than must study test and bia ACE points... NOOOOOO... so bad, like time management so easy. even the teachers take xtra long periods of time to mark sum lame wksht. and worst of all is that hve to file it...   man. no wonder, its term 3 and end-of-year exams coming soon!! i...cant...get...exempted for any... -_- where r the tears? at least got o humans paper tis year. now i am juz doing tis thing bcoz i dun feel lyk touching hmwk (hve a bit but same as none) or mrp. i hve no idea wat to do. its like piles of info, dunno wad 2 do wif it. well, at least i take time to de-stress myself, and laugh a ton at sch coz e pple there r insane and got all kind of farney jokes (literally ALL KINDS).   church is so fun. i used to think it kinda stinked. used to be a worldly christian (if u noe wat tat means). now i am born-again! thx God if not i'll still be pretty screwed and most propbably worse off. oh ya i gtg soon coz irritating sis wanna plae sum puzzle games... haiz, she addicted but i come home 1st ;P  here's something to think about: i am sure u hve heard of pple who, well, stopped being christian. their reason, coz they tot being one would be a breeze and u would lead the best life ever and it will be yi4 fan1 feng1 shun4. it turned out they led pretty hard lifes and thus eventually gave up. heres the punchline, if they lead harder lives with god around, than what would their lives be if they did not hve Him? well, actually i hve tons ore stuff to tok bout, but i feel so down in the dumps(stressed) actually i put them here so i wun 4get them :)  hope u pple out there will hve peace, coz its hard to find. but i noe how. find God! go 2 ur nearest church today for more information. (doesnt it sound lyk an advertisement? i would feel lyk puking if not the fact that i wrote it. lol)  God Bless!
