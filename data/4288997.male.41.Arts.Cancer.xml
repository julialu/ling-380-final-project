       urlLink    A friend asked me to take a few shots of her cat. It's interesting to see the reaction when people see this image. This image has won best of show, member's choice and a second place finish in three different competitions.&nbsp; urlLink

       urlLink    This shot was also taken during "Doors Open", Toronto. This lady walked to the railing on the second floor and I snapped a few shots of her. Her wardrobe and posing really worked in the shots.&nbsp; urlLink

       urlLink    Having some fun in the studio and editing the image on the computer gave me this. This image always gets a laugh when it's on display. &nbsp; urlLink

       urlLink    Was fooling around in the studio one day and after a bit of photo editing came up with this.&nbsp; urlLink

       urlLink    These were anchored just off the pier. Don't think it would be the same without the clouds.&nbsp; urlLink

       urlLink    Although one of the best spots in Ontario for sunsets rarely do you get the sun setting on the horizon like this.&nbsp; urlLink

       urlLink    I spent about an hour in Port Delhousie shooting, with the two piers it is easy to get shots like this.&nbsp; urlLink

       urlLink    This is a classic example of being in the right spot at the right time. Took this about 10 years ago in Port Delhousie. One of the few times the sun set on the horizon without any clouds. I watched and waited hoping the boat would get in front of the sun before it set completely. This shot was taken with a 500mm mirror lens with a 2X converter attached.&nbsp; urlLink
