       urlLink    This is the house I've found to buy in Scotland.  I've always complained about my dwellings not having enough ventilation.  This one seems perfect though.  And it's cheap.  It's located in a little place called Middle Nowhereshire.   Do you like it?&nbsp; urlLink

      So, when's everyone gonna fly/drive to this thing? AprilTrue, I'm thinking we should try to get in at the same time so people can come pick us up... or we could rent a car or something. How long you thinking of taking off work? Just trying to figure this out as buying the plane ticket is needed pretty soon for the good cheap Reno to Portland rate.
