      [ OsT : World Filled With LoVe - craig david ]  Reborn. From failure. From sadness. From bad past. From disappointment. From deep sorrow. From depression. From grief. From misery.     The sun'll come out  Tomorrow  Bet your bottom dollar  That tomorrow  There'll be sun!   Just thinkin' about  Tomorrow  Clears away the cobwebs,  And the sorrow  'Til there's none!   When I'm stuck with a day  That's gray,  And lonely,  I just stick out my chin  And Grin,  And Say,  Oh   The sun'll come out  Tomorrow  So ya gotta hang on  'til tomorrow  Come what may   Tomorrow!  Tomorrow!  I love ya  Tomorrow!  You're always  A day  A way!    (OST of Annie, "Tomorrow")   This post dedicated to 2 persons i love so much. I hope you both can smile happily soon. My prayers adn supports always be with you both.

      [OsT : Tamia's Officially Missing You]  I don't feel to write something these days... Especially today. It seems that everything goes wrong and sad, plus teary. Bad day, i may say. Really. I'm not in mood to write more. It has been hours and I still feel it's just only another bad dream, and I'm going to wake up soon.  But it's really not. It's a reality. I must face it. He must, she must. I don't want to describe who 'he' is, and who 'she' is. Life goes on, life never stops only for waiting. Failure is only a delayed success. Don't you ever give up.  *Ganbatte for 2 persons i love much!*  [ m i t a ]
