      Everything is moving so quickly Im trying to take everything in stride I realize that every day with u is a blessing and im blessed to have you.  Then it comes the time to say goodbye We both sit and wonder why? We both cry when we leave But we know we shall stay together indeed  Everytime I talk to you im in heaven My heart beats so fast I feel like im the best woman in the world,  when im with you.

      yesterday was a weird day. Me n Lisa went to Wal Mart so she could get a new bathing suit! It was fun lol so anyways we went to BlockBuster and then we came home cooked lunch and then we watched some of Monster and then Lisa's dad said that he is comming over in 45 mins to get her, so then i just gave her the DVD to watch.. and yeah.. then i went back to sleep.. cuz i didnt/ dont feel good.  And then i started to wonder about alot of things. Some good things some bad things. and i wondered how much i miss them now that they are gone. Bcuz now when i need that person the most they are like 2000 miles away.   Doug i miss you.

With you, I fall so fast I can hardly catch my breath, I hope it lasts  Ohhhhh It seems like I can finally rest my head on something real I like the way that feels Ohhhhh It's as if you've known me better than I ever knew myself I love how you can tell All the pieces, pieces, pieces of me All the pieces, pieces, pieces of me  I am moody, messy I get restless, and it's senseless How you never seem to care When I'm angry, you listen When youre happy, it's a mission And you wont stop 'til I'm there  Fall... Sometimes I fall so fast Well, I hit that bottom Crash, you're all I have  [Chorus:] Ohhhhh It seems like I can finally rest my head on something real I like the way that feels Ohhhhh It's as if you known me better than I ever knew myself I love how you can tell All the pieces, pieces, pieces of me  How do you know everything I'm about to say? Am I that obvious? And if it's written on my face... I hope it never goes away... yeah  On a Monday, I am waiting And by Tuesday, I am fading into your arms... So I can breathe  [Chorus:] Ohhhhh It seems like I can finally rest my head on something real I like the way that feels Ohhhhh It's as if you've know me better than I ever knew myself I love how you can tell Ohhhhh I love how you can tell Ohhhhh I love how you can tell All the pieces, pieces, pieces of me All the pieces, pieces, pieces of me...
