       urlLink    keny and i got to run out for a brief second between all the storms we've been having lately so i could shoot these blue windows.  i pass this building every day and see these windows.  keny hates posing but agreed to sit in this shot.  it turned out to be my favorite shot with the windows and one of the best shots i've gotten of keny in a while.

       urlLink    i shot this in january.  pebbles loves having her picture taken.  it wasn't until febuary that i printed this picture and then noticed there was more to this picture than just the cat.  in the reflection in the guitar there seems to an old man peeking up over the shadows.  i have asked everyone i kow what they think of this and all seem to be in agreement that i apparently "caught a ghost".  what do you think?

       urlLink    when i shot this i thought i had food poisoning.  i only got one shot and was dissapointed in it because half my face was cut off.  however, i was in too much pain to reshoot it and i just went to bed.  eight hours later i was in the er having emergency surgery (it was not food poisoning after all).  when i got out of the hospital, i looked at this photo again and it seemed to say more to me.  my father had an interesting dream about all that.

       urlLink    she creeps in the dark crouched in the pounce position waiting for her next victim (usually me).&nbsp; her name is pebbles-not to be messed with.&nbsp; i am convinced she is the reincarnation of a vietnam vet permanently stuck in a flash back.&nbsp;

       urlLink    this has been an interesting day.  keny came and woke me while i was napping earlier to inform me that there was something happening on the street.  this 16 year old kid was to say the least upset.  after punching the glass door behind him, he was asked to leave the area.  he then threw himself through the glass window next to the door.  it is amazing that this kid didnt hurt himself any worse than he did.
