      Hey all.  Some updates for you.  The 2004 Pennsylvaia State Studnet Council Conference is at one of our members high schools'.  He is a co-chair of the event.  We are working on what we can do for A's For Africa there.  We are also contacting a local radio host in the Waynesboro Area.  Her name is Delilah, she has her own program 7pm-12am Monday through Friday.  Why are we contacting her you ask, well does is astonish you that she is taking a trip to Africa herself.  Go visit her site to learn more about her trip www.radiodelilah.com.  I am working to see if she can put us on the  air or help us in anyway, like being a resource person.  Cross your fingers that she e-mails me  back and says "Yes I can help you guys"  Watch for more updates about this.

      Hello, all.  It is getting down to the end of school, the call of the summer is coming.  Remember that you can start a fundraiser this summer.  You can start one with donation jars by getting permission from a resturant owner or manager and putting it near the register.  You can also start one in your community.  Get the word out!  -Mike
