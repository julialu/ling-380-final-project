      yeah..1st day of summer vacation. somehoug i thought it would be better than this. highlight of the day: tagging a whole bunch of mp3s (people have horrible tags). oh, something else... i'm looking for a laptop. want an ibm, but they're way too expensive, i guess i'll just go with a toshiba.. P M1.7ghz 1GB RAM 60GB HDD DVD-RW, yep, tightest shit out there.  -if I sold my soul for a bag of gold, which one of us would be the foolish one?

      so i took the ap bio test, and it was like 20 questions!! easy easy easy, but somehow i still managed to only get an 85 :-(  but i'm done with high school!!  -now i'm lost and scared...don't know where to go.

      I've finished the pre-cal exam!!! SO EASY!! i really thought it was going to be harder than it was. after i finshed the pre-cal exam, i just decided to pay a visit to mrs. wyigul "hey mrs. wyigul, i want to take my Ap bio exam" and then she's like "oh, i haven't written it yet, come back 4th block" and then i'm like "sald;fjlsadlk". so i'm stuck here in school with nothing to do (yeah!...NOT when it's your last day and you could be home right now), almost ready to graduate, and i have to wait to take my ap bio exam.                                          -this high school just doesn't want to let me go

      so..hmm, i got finals tomorrow. i'm too stupid to be excempt from pre-cal and AP bio.  i've got like a 75 or so average, so i can't bomb the exam. in Bio i've got an 81, and the test will be pretty easy, so i'm not worried too much about that one. as long as i don't get a 'd' or below, i'll be alright. BUT HEY!!! tomorrow will be the last day of my 'memorable' high school career!!                                                      -hopefully it will all be good in the end.
