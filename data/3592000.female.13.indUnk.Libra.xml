      ok well no one reads this and i know it (exept MAYBE sam) so im just guna put a whole buncha love quotes in here. yah im not a very big fan of them but im bored and alot of them actually do express my feelings. so here it goes  "some say love is a razour that leaves the soul bleeding."   "There are so many things I wish I could tell you, but I can't. I'm not sure if you would ever understand because I don't understand half of it. I want to be with you so bad, but I'm so afraid of getting hurt and because of that, I end up getting hurt more. I can sit here and say that I don't care about you and that I'm not going to let you hurt me, and just by saying that I know that you can and have. Itâ€™s not your fault, it never is. Its me."  "i cant cry hard enough for u to hear me"  "I know i made a lot of stupid mistakes in my life but the worst one was thinking the person who hurt me the most wouldent hurt me again"  "The worst feeling in the world is loving someone when they dont love you back . Your heart aches  , everytime you see him knowing that no matter how deep you look into his eyes trying to reach there heart you never will"  "I could fill a thousand pages telling you how i felt, but still you'd never understand. so now i leave without a sound exept that of my heart shattering as it hits the ground"  "When i see you smile and know its not for me, that is when i will miss you the most."  "I know i have a heart, cuz i can feel it breaking".-Wizard Of Oz  "If this is just a crush i dont think i could handle the real thing."  "love can be deep inside, or it can be suicide"  "love me or hate me but spare me your indifferance"   "love is very real, you will find it some day. but it has one enemy. and thats life."  "The person who tries to live alone will not succeed as a human being. His heart withers if it does not answer another heart. His mind shrinks away if he hears only the echoes of his own thoughts and finds no other inspiration."  "Love is a perky elf dancing a merry little jig and then suddenly he turns on you with a miniature machine gun. " (love that 1)  "she loved him, pride be damned, for it was lost, cast along with dignity upon the shores of emotion. for come what may in truth she could not deny him, nor herself"   alrite im done with them. well nothings really happened lately. i stayed in the sun till i about got skin cancer, but i still dontt gota tan! oh well. i think im gina go now.   ~Cya at the show ~LeVi

(surprise surprise)Cailyn stayed the night last night and my brother was home (he was stoned) and he was throwing our dog in the air, chanting 'WEEEEE!!!" it was hilarious. Me and Cailyn just sorta hung out for a while, (all night really) and yah...It was great. I didn't wanna go skating. u know why i didn't wana go skating? cuz IM tired of these little low life assholes who go there to fuckin slob down there boy friend or girlfriend!!! I mean really, who really wants to be skating, look over and see you basically humping someone. i dont. you people really need to get a fuckin room, IM tired of being afraid to go in the god damn bathroom because threes probably some fuckin orgy going on. u wana fuck in the bathroom? GO IN UR OWN GOD DAMN BATHROOM!!thats just my opinion. if u wana hump, hump in the privacy of ur own home. stay the fuck away from me.
