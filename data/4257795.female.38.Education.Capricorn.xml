       Well, I've started it.  So to speak. I've been writing it all summer but with a little motivation and a lot of angst, Molly Lawrence is now on her way to London to meet the man of her dreams.  Will she find happiness in the arms of the dashing Englishman?  Will the same curse that stole her fiance Scott away from her happen again?  Can Molly finally stand on her own two feet and face the curse head on and defeat it?   Ah, those are interesting questions........You'll have to buy the book.   Cheers - Kenzie

       To AJ for listening to me tonight. We covered a lot of area and she helped me narrow down, no actually make the choice to work on my more contemporary story "London Calling".  I'm looking forward to exorcising my "demons" with this story.   And I've made a decision, in 15 minutes (it's 11:45 pm) the "She who shall not be named" era will formally end.  I have de'shewhoshallnotbenamed my computer, gotten rid of all traces of her writing and anything else.  So, thanks to everyone who let me vent and get it all out of my system.  It's amazing the depths of deception a friend will go. Got a pretty long knife in me back. ;)

       Most definitely frightning......   After all the stops and starts, I finally ended up with a new hard drive with more memory (and an interesting game in the history).  Last night I was setting up the new computer and an unbelievable storm ripped through.  The first clap of thunder was so loud it shook the house and blew the power on the street. Power came right back on but the storm raged on for a bit longer. Luckily the computer survived, though I backed away from it until the storm died down.         and FB - thanks for your comments on my writing, but now I'm having a doubt or two.

       *Note to self* Be thankful that you backed up all your stories and research - fucking stuff got lost when I rebooted.
