      Summer is great long days on the beach, hangingout with friends, catching the summer blockbusters.  My summer has come just a little short.  Most of my time has been spent sleeping, watching tv and, because no one fuckin told me i had to read 1000 pages over the summer , ive been reading 50 pages a day.  Nothing says fun like sleeping all day then waking up to watch tv and read owell what-a-ya gonna do anyway everone else enjoy thier summer and leave a comment  Hug Count:0

       Mister sean got me on blogger yipee first post. Anyway long day today, Woodfield with Allison, fun oodles of walking bought shoes bling bling, ate at the Cheesecake Factory very good then took the bus and train back, we met the gang (*inhale* me, allison, barbara, josh, paul, and little battaglio *exhale*) walked back to the battaglio residence picked up by mama gallagher and driven home we could have killed my mom but allison's mom missed her chance got home and ate me some custom ice cream so now its late   Tip of the Day:  urlLink http://allofmp3.com/  now you'll notice right away (unless your in Russia) that this is a russian web site. In the upper left conner you'll need to click on the english tab. now the best part of this site that you'll see if you click around is that 1. The have a very large database of music including bestsellers lists 2. You can download the songs or whole albums into quite a few formats including .wma, .mp3, for you i tunes fans .aac and o whole buch a wierd ones 3.  THE BEST PART  Instead of purchasing a song for 99 cents as in i tunes and napster or 89 centsas in walmart.com the price at allofmp3.com goes from a penny thats right a penny a Megabite for the lowest quality which i found is just fine too a stagering 2 cents for cd quality which is exactly as advertised and very good quality. The higher the quality the higher the megabite total. For example i bought the usher CD with just over an hour of music i used the lowest qulity at a penny a Mb and it cost me 57 cents and it sounds damn good for CD quality it would have been 626 Mb and at 2 cents a Mb thats 12 and a half bucks for some good and some bad songs 12.50 is pretty close to a full price cd i personally choose to pay 57 cents for a little less quality. Now my parents didnt want to had thier credit card over to a russian web site and if yours do thats fine and it makes things easier but allofmp3.com also takes Paypal  urlLink http://paypal.com/  If youve never heard of it before its a free service based in this country where you deposit money on to a paypal acount and then can use this to purchase things. Heres what i did, after smashing my piggy bank and counting every last penny a gave my dad 5 bucks and he put the money on the paypal for 5 bucks i got 8 full CD's not bad p.s. you can burn the cd's as many times as you want or you can just download one song for 3 cents. If you've taken the time to read this youve not only saved yourself a couple bucks on CD's and shown me that i can find a russian web site and write a quite lengthy for my taste article on it  Holly shit that took a long time    Hug count: 0
