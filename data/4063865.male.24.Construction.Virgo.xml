      la la  lalalalalalalala I wrote her off for the tenth time today, And practiced all the things I would say, But she came over I lost my nerve, I took her back and made her dessert, Now I know, I'm being used, That's okay man cause I like the abuse, I know she's playing with me, That's okay cause I've got no self esteem, We make plans to go out at night I wait till 2 then I turn out the light, All this rejection's got me so low If she keeps it up I just might tell her so, When she's saying that she wants only me, Then I wonder why she sleeps with my friends, When she's saying that I'm like a disease, Then I wonder how much more I can spend, Well I guess I should stick up for myself, But I really think it's better this way, The more you suffer, The more it shows you really care Right? Now I'll relate this a little bit, That happens more than I'd like to admit, Late at night she knocks on my door, Drunk again and looking to score, Now I know I should say no But that's kind of hard when she's ready to go, I may be dumb But I'm not a dweeb I'm just a sucker with no self esteem.
