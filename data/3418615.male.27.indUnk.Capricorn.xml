      Ou a volta, como preferir. Resolvi escrever minhas idéias na internet - de novo. Talvez no futuro encontre alguma utilidade para isso, mas no momento é mais pra curtir uma onda. Estou meio feliz. É que a Carol (minha esposa) me deu um gelo por causa de uma diferença de opinião sobre o uso do micro de madrugada. Além disso estou recém operado de uma @#%&¨* de um cisto pilonidal recidivante. Pensei em incluir uma foto do bicho mas acho melhor começar pegando leve.

      "Papai! Papai!", gritou Luana ao me ver em casa quando chegou com a Dudi, com quem passara o dia ontem. Pedrinho é o cara mais tranqüilo e simpático: dá risada o tempo todo e -tímido - vira o rosto encabulado... Hoje Luana tem 3 anos e Pedro, 4 meses. Tenho uma família linda e só poderia ser mais feliz se tivesse mais tempo para passar com eles. Ainda bem que Carol é compreensiva, ela sabe que por enquanto nossa sobrevivência depende dos meus plantões. Mas isso pode estar prestes a mudar... Tomara!

      People with diabetes mellitus are at risk of developing the vision disorder known as diabetic retinopathy. This condition occurs as a result of damage to the small blood vessels in the retina�the light-sensitive lining at the back of the eye. Symptoms may include blurred central or side vision, or a blind spot in the central vision. Prompt medical treatment can prevent this condition from worsening.   urlLink

      Glaucoma occurs when increased pressure within the eye causes harm to the optic nerve, which carries visual information from the eye to the brain. A common symptom is the loss of side, or peripheral, vision. Those at risk of developing glaucoma include African Americans, diabetics, people over age 40, and people with a family history of the disease. If detected and treated in its early stages, glaucoma can be controlled and vision can be saved.   urlLink

      Macular degeneration is the most common cause of irreversible vision loss in the United States. People with this condition gradually lose their central visionthe part of vision needed for reading and seeing fine details. Such people rarely become completely blind because their side, or peripheral, vision remains intact.   urlLink
