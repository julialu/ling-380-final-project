      I presented a workshop for Janus in San Francisco on 6/28 that introduced a new paradigm for how to think about dominance and submission.&nbsp; In short, the&nbsp;concept is called the "REDS" scale, or, the Regimence/Electence D/s theory. It identifies different elements underlying kinky power dynamics than we have previously pinpointed, explains what typifies them and how they inform our relationship styles.   I'm not going to get into that in detail here because I am writing about it for academic and book publication, and will be presenting on this topic at subsequent bdsm community workshops in the coming months (though I will attempt to reduce this to a thumbnail sketch suitable for web publication soon: I've already been discussing the concepts in some blogs and elsewhere.) Meanwhile, though, I wanted to share a related thought or two.   Essentially, I don't believe that the words and concepts "Dominance" and "submission" at all capture the&nbsp; underlying psycho-social *dynamics* (the underpinnings; the skeletal bare bones) that are really in place when we engage in power exchange. In fact, there is a whole body of sociology and social psychology studies and theory closely relating to this topic that have never (as far as my researches have uncovered) been applied to the kink community. Yet these (hitherto unexplored) concepts give insight into what it is that we're doing in ways that have implications for everyone from individuals for whom&nbsp; "D/s is whatever you want it to be," to our uniform and (dare I say it) predictable behaviors as a kinky population.   As some of you may know, I have been in the midst of a mid-life career shift that will take me on to law school and my JD.&nbsp; Right now I am at the tail end of my Sociology degree work. In the course of my studies I've been paying particular attention to things like the bodies of work regarding power-dependence, equity and distributive justice, coercive power, role & identity and other elements that factor into what we call simply "D/s".&nbsp; As fallout from this process, I have evolved a model of D/s dynamics that reframes the discussion to what I believe are the metastructures that inform and energize power exchange.&nbsp;   That subject, again, goes beyond what I am willing to get into, in this post. So I think, perhaps, this missive is really just a Teaser (yes, I know, Bad Teramis, not posting a complete concept) and a Fulmination: to wit, that we are frequently barking up the wrong tree in our kink discussions - or at the very least, slogging through Very Muddy Waters - by virtue of being constrained by the concepts and vocabulary we have historically assigned to discuss WIITWD.   I propose to change that and broaden that conversation - and hopefully, to fine tune it -&nbsp; by introducing the concepts of regimence, electence, and the D/s scale, and showing how they work together as underpinning of power exchange dynamics. Even more to the point, this goes beyond being my personal "theory du jour" and incorporates a body of established and testable social science theory that could be extended to studies of and work with the broader bdsm population.&nbsp; In short, I propose a model and a theory that is testable and founded in proven social science theory, not merely an arguable proposition concocted of today's transient brainstorm.   Ok, that's enough circuitous conversation for now. My bottom line is, I will be getting into this Stuff at some point in my forthcoming blogs, as time goes by (a gradual introduction and dialog, if you will) with pointers to substantive discourse on my website, when revisions are done there.   I suppose that this missive is your personal warning shot across the bow.&nbsp; (heh heh)   My limiting factor will be time to do this kind of writing. (and I am, alas, very limited in that regard right now).&nbsp; Though I trust subsequent volleys will follow in due course, regardless of our collective pace across the waters.   ~~~  A related note:&nbsp; BLANKET REUSE PERMISSION   Any and all parties are welcome to repost/redistribute/reuse ANY AND ALL of my writings that appear in public fora.

        I was talking recently with some friends and the question came up, "what are the three essential requirements for a good D/s relationship?"   Much to the surprise of some of the participants - and to the shock, no doubt, of the Xian Right, were they listening in -&nbsp; the answers volunteered were  not  along the lines of&nbsp; "plenty of whippings and lots of chains."   Rather, the consensus offered in this conversation (and similar ones I've had across the years) -&nbsp; included requirements like:   - communications  - understanding that relationships take work  - contribute to positive energy in the relationship  - be open to negotiation ('be flexible')   There were many others as well, but this gem particularly stuck with me:&nbsp; "Recognize there is only love and fear, and make choices from love."&nbsp;   Indeed.   At the end of the discussion it was evident that the most important elements in D/s relationships are the same fundamental elements it takes to make a  healthy  relationship happen, period.   This of course did not precisely answer the question of what was required for a  D/s  relationship, but I find it very telling that when confronted with a question like that, intelligent, insightful and experienced kinky folk reached first into their Relationship Toolkit and pulled out....fundamental relationship skills and attitudes as their prescription for successful D/s.    I  thought that that would happen, but then, I've been around this block a few times.&nbsp; I share this here because I think a lot of folks who don't Get It, need to grok what I wrote above.&nbsp; So go back and read that again, if you like.   (I'll wait a moment while you do...)   As to "what is required for D/s", as such -&nbsp; I think there is only one essential difference between D/s and vanilla relationships.&nbsp; I would characterize that special "D/s thing" as "explicit agreements about control and compliance", i.e., what we also call "negotiated power exchange" - emphasis on "negotiated."&nbsp; That also means that "control and compliance" are a huge and vague category. What that looks like, in detail, is going to vary for every D/s couple. But the commonality will be, that there  are  some kind of explicit agreements in place regarding power exchange.   Put simply: what a D/s relationship  must  have is a stable, healthy foundation (a la the examples I gave above)  plus  explicit agreements about control and compliance -  however  that is worked out between the couple. The structure and style of those agreements don't really matter: what is critical is the fact of their existance.   And that, I think, is the fine dividing line between vanilla (unacknowledged power exchange) and D/s (negotiated power exchange).   -Teramis    &nbsp;

      In addition to blogspot,&nbsp;I also post at livejournal&nbsp; ( urlLink www.livejournal.com/users/teramis ). It is my intention to keep essay-length thinky pieces there as well as here (continuity of memes, you know). In thinking through this strategy, I look around blog- and network-community land and see that a lot of bdsm people (most people?) choose to put their kinked lifestyle experiences behind some kind of lock or access barrier.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  I am making a choice to keep my D/s-related ruminations on completely publicly accessible pages with no filters in place. I am doing this because I do not believe discussions of what are essentially relationship dynamics warrant sequestering. Children of all ages can surf the web and read dating tips, relationship tips, 'how to' for marital interactions, and myriad other het, vanilla, mainstream-oriented relationship advice and opinions. We do not lock that material away from the eyes of the straight or the underage for fear that frank discussion of relationships (not sexuality, but *relationships*) will somehow permanently warp the brain of the onlooker. Nor should we.  &nbsp;  I wonder, then - given the multitude of ways there are to talk about bdsm/kinky/D/s interactions - why so many of us choose to self-censor or omit from public view our experiences in *our* loving dynamics.  &nbsp;  Relationships are, at the heart of it, essentially about the same things: communications, trust, honesty, love, commitment, etc. The essential distinguishing factor between D/s relationships and heterosexual Ozzie-and-Harriet ones, as far as I have been able to tell, is the fact that the vanilla one has an unnegotiated power exchange at its root, and in D/s, that power exchange is explicitly negotiated. Everything else is set dressing.  &nbsp;  Now, that is something that I think deserves frank presentation. I am not going to self-censor because of some vague fear that WIITWD [what it is that we do] is by its very nature offensive to others and should be shielded from the eyes of casual onlookers. To the contrary: I see a great deal of analog between WIITWD, and what it is that "they" do. Relationship issues are, at the end of the day, relationship issues, regardless of how kinkily or conservatively they are decked out.  &nbsp;  That, then, is my interjectory thought of the day regarding what will likely be my next post here, and what will no doubt be more in the future.&nbsp; D/s is not all I write about, but it bears as much weight in my free speech as all the rest of my Sturm und Drang.  &nbsp;  -Teramis

       urlLink Cornerstone Placed At Trade Center Site (washingtonpost.com) :  "Gov. George E. Pataki (R) said he chose July 4 to begin rebuilding [the World Trade Center] to show that the terrorists who attacked New York on Sept. 11, 2001, didn't destroy America's faith in freedom. "  I'm sorry, is it just me? Or does this country suffer from an abnormal conflationary tendency regarding FREEDOM and flag-drapping?   When Israelis shoot rockets into men in wheelchairs, do Palestinians claim the victim died to preserve their freedom?  When Palestinians blow up schoolkids on Israeli buses, do the Israelis claim they died for the cause of freedom?   When roadside bombs go off in Baghdad, do our soldiers die for our  freedom ? or could it be, they are kakking to protect our  interests  and those of the friendly Iraqis? - a subtle but important distinction.   This is like an ugly hangover from the administration's first patriotic coping gestures during September 2001. "They attack us because they hate our freedoms," Bush told us.    Well...no.  They attack us because they hate our nation's  actions  overseas, on many fronts.  These have been clearly enumerated in many fora and the freedoms we enjoy do not even appear on the list.  They do not sit and sharpen knives, muttering, "Damn, those Americans can vote! Damn, they have freedom of the press (sorta)!  We hate it that we don't have our MTV, and Americans do...!"  - thus reducing their hatred to a litany of freedoms envied and desired, yet denied.   Yet regardless of the obvious disconnect between "America attacked" and "freedom envy", our instant kneejerk reflex as a wounded nation is to "rally 'round the flag" and drape ourselves in it - or is that, smother ourselves in it to the occlusion of all clear thinking about the terrorism we were victim to.   Those poor people who perished in the twin towers did not do so on behalf of "freedom" (or because they represented freedom) any more than did terrorism-slaughtered Israelis, Palestinians, Iraqis or G.I.s.  They perished because someone did violence to them out of an animal urge to strike out in anger and hatred, to force behaviors in a terrorized population that are not achievable in any other way. No more, no less.    Must we all be media sheep and swallow the flag-draped, hark-to-glory pablum that enshrines our "heroes" but ignores all the many realities that their deaths represent?  Symbols are good. Every country, every people need symbols. They are comforting, even inspiring. It is no surprise that a memorial and new construction (the new tower) bearing a Freedom theme and statue-of-liberty resemblance, would win the nod for reconstruction.  But to pretend - as we collectively seem insistant on doing - that  freedom  - purportedly envied, threatened, and salvaged in the face of threat - has anything to do with the realities of the Trade Towers and 9/11 - is to live in a comfortable patriotic bubblewrap mind-numbingly removed from what delivered this threat to our doors.   We can't deal with the real world in any way - much less effectively - when we choose to live in bubblewrap.   -Teramis

      I just responded elsewhere to a discussion re a service submissive and whether her offer to clean house and then go away, no strings attached, was legit. It was striking to me how many people instantly bristle at the idea and say outright that they suspect ulterior motives when they hear such an offer.   I think for a large portion of the D/s world, particularly those used to playing in  SDDs (scene-delimited D/s) encounters where the quid pro quo is obvious, such a service offer without obvious exchange value looks odd, even unbelievable. But I am put in mind of various people of my acquaintance who are most excellent and dedicated service submissives, who go into a virtual zen state of "chop wood, carry water", and putz and schlep and do until the task is done - and that, in and of itself warms the cockles of their hearts. Add to that, doing this service for someone they like and respect (much less love or have a crush on! ;) - and they are in hog heaven.   While I also have known many submissives who have concocted service scenarios as a (rather obvious) way to worm their way into association with a dominant, these other, truly service-oriented subs *do* exist, and I think are priceless gems. It is unfortunate that people see that espoused attitude and become suspicious of it, when a little dialog, IMX, is sufficient to determine where the person is really coming from.  Besides, I wouldn't engage with anyone that way unless I enjoyed their energy to begin with. But if so, it could be a mutually fulfilling relationship.   Maybe at the heart of this suspicon factor (ie, "what are you getting out it?!?") is a lack of attunement to the exchange the service submissive perceives they are getting. The service IS the quid pro quo.  Maybe I need to write something about this at essay length and put it on my website (currently under revision). There's a lot to say about exchange value and equity that is really spot-on in this discussion.   Bottom line, though: I think it's easy to screen out the boneheads, but it is also too easy to dismiss the true service-oriented submissive when the  Dom/me is not attuned to the quid pro quo in the pure-service dynamic. And that's a loss.

      I used to have a fitfully appearing newsletter through Topica, spinoff from fan interest in my novels (full name: Deborah Teramis Christian; under the DC name my sf/fantasy novels can be eyeballed at amazon.com, if you're not already acquainted). The T Report covered writing and personal doings in the bdsm scene and other things of interest as well.   I discovered newsletters are a pain, and I don't have time to handle one on a regular basis. But since I usually have Something to Say and can find the odd moment to dash off a comment here and there, I thought I'd give the blog thing a try. Three friends now have urged me to join or look at content here and in other blogspaces, so there's that magic number three and the universe dropping subtle hints on my head. Ok ok I give.
