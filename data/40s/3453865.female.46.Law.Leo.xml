      Now a huge investigation is taking place in Norway, Sweden, Finland and Denmark concerning paedophilia. According to the Portuguese newspaper "Público", at least 350 persons are already under detention.  The stupid creatures were caught because they used their credit cards to pay membership in several Internet sites.  However, I'm amazed to read that in Sweden the maximum punishion for paedophilia is two years in prison. Can this be true in a country that has life imprisonement ?????  Will you comment, Lena ?

      This is the sort of news that never fails a day. I shall quote Agence France Presse.   Agence France Presse  26 May 2004   GAZA CITY, May 26-- A Palestinian man was killed Wednesday by  Israeli fire in the southern Gaza Strip town of Rafah, site of a  devastating week-long Israeli raid that ended earlier this week,  Palestinian medical sources said.   Mohammed Zurob, 42, was hit in the chest by fire originating from  an Israeli army position near the border between the Gaza Strip  and Egypt, the sources said.   He was near the Tal al-Sultan neighborhood in the Rafah refugee  camp when he was hit, witnesses said.   It was not immediately clear why the Israeli army opened fire.   Meanwhile, an ambulance crew recovered the body of a second  Palestinian, killed overnight near the Sufa crossing point between  Gaza and Israel, Palestinian sources said.   Imad Abu Eid, 21, who had been shot in the head, did not belong to  any militant organization, relatives said.   The army said that Tuesday night troops had fired on and hit a  suspect Palestinian approaching the security barrier, having  earlier received intelligence of possible Palestinian attacks.   Israeli troops withdrew from Rafah town and the adjacent refugee  camp on Monday after a week-long offensive that claimed the lives  of 43 Palestinians and levelled dozens of homes.   The death brought to 4,085 the number of people killed since the  September 2000 outbreak of the Palestinian uprising, including  3,096 Palestinians and 918 Israelis, according to an AFP count.

      This is a news I've just read. UK has 8,000 soldiers in Iraq but they seem not to be enough. The British government intends to send 370 more soldiers to Iraq.  Curious ! Weren't they suppose to start leaving Iraq on June 30th, when the "new Iraqi government" is given the power ? (which power, I would also like to know....)

      I've just heard on news that Portugal is  again  denounced in the last report from Amnesty International, because of :  - lawsuits take ages to come to an end, making justice arrive delayed; - long preventive detentions; - bad treatment and injuries over people detained or imprisoned by police elements.  As a Law person, I can't help being shocked that my country is  again  among those that don't respect human rights.  I shall try to know which other self-called "  civilized  " countries are in the list this year. If you know of any, please tell us.

      When I  watch the news on TV  I  just  ask  this  question: What kind  of world do we live  in ?  In my country (Portugal) many cases of paedophilia were recently investigated and many well-known people seem to be involved. Yesterday I knew there were 720 cases of missing children during the year of 2002.  Many crimes of corruption are committed and have been under investigation . The government is the worst we have ever had since constitutional democracy was established in 1976, many people lose their jobs every day, economy is a disaster.   I feel sick when I watch that news about my country but this is not all. When I look at confronts between the Americans troops and Iraquian people I just cannot believe in the atrocities committed by those Americans. Why do they do those horrible things, why do they torture that people, why???? Where are the values of live, where are the human rights? They just look like psychopathic criminals, terrifying innocent people. And after all, they haven't given them the promised liberty, they are destroying Iraq. President Bush is guilty of so many crimes against humanity, why doens't anybody judge him? Why do Americans accept such imbecile, mad and ignorant person as the President of their country?  Why does the world support crimes committed by Israel in Palestine? So many questions but the main one is "Can't We Do  Anything ???"  I am  very  angry and tired  of  seeing  all those  things happening  and  not doing anything  to  help stop them.

      I've just had a look on the Portuguese newspapers on-line and the main national news seems to be the football (soccer) match between the Portuguese team FC Porto and Monaco. It's the last match to decide which team wins the main European cup in matches between football teams.  So, it is quite predictable what is going to happen. People will be rushing home to watch the match on TV and Portugal will stop during 105 minutes. Watching football matches is one of the favourite interests of most Portuguese males.  Soon (June 12th) UEFA Cup Championship will be held in Portugal. Several new stadia were built to receive the teams and their supporters. Meanwhile I doubt if any new hospital, for instance, was built...  I often wonder how football has become such a powerful "industry" that moves lots of money. Players receive huge wages and are "bought" by clubs as if they were merchandise. Football has become an important social event in many countries and people may get crazy and violent if their team loses a match.  During the Portuguese dictatorship (1926-1974), it was said that people were glad with the three "f" : football, fado and Fátima. Democracy came but football interest has prevailed.  I would like to know what you think of this money machine called football (if you are from USA, you probably have an equivalent sport in terms of popularity and power, which I suppose is baseball) and its role in our societies.

      Well, I should be sleeping but I've decided to invite some people I don't know but whose profiles I've read, so now invitations have been sent to other countries and more to the USA, including to a person who wrote in his interests : "removing the resident idiot from the white house".   In the morning I will run to the computer to see who has joined !!  I would really like this blog to have members from different countries. That's why I haven't created a blog in Portuguese language. Variety of people is precious.

      Benjamin Franklin once said :  " Those who give up freedom for security do not deserve any of them ! "  I agree on this sentence and I think freedom is one of the human rights. Dictatorship as we had in Portugal (1926-1974) has stolen people's freedom but it made most Portuguese, in their ignorance, feel secure within the limits imposed.   I don't think we should limit freedom for the sake of security.

      Listen what the new prime minister of Iraq has in store for his country:  He said the first item on his agenda will be to crack down on disorder by reinstating capital punishment and creating a new security force similar to the one in Britain and in the United States.   "We need to reconstitute or build an internal security apparatus similar to MI-5 or the FBI, which has power of interrogation and detention," said Alawi.   Except from:  urlLink http://www.cbc.ca/stories/2004/06/11/iraq_coalition040611  These words appear in last two paragraphs.  Sounds a lot like his predecessor, doesn't it?  I guess that's what you get with ANOTHER hand picked (by USA) government running the country. Do you suppose his interrogation tactics will be inspired by the USA's recent Iraqi interrogation policies?  If you're religious, say a prayer for those poor people.  Pat

      I'm disheartened...  Here's a great article on what Kerry need to do to win:  urlLink  http://www.guardian.co.uk/uselections2004/comment/story/0,14259,1229376,00.html   These guys are right on the money!  But they focus only on Kerry getting elected without thinking about "what comes next".  While I agree with their analysis it only adds fuel to the fire that's already burning in my heart.  Think about what an awful president Kerry is going to be, if he manages to get elected.  I'm less troubled with him FINDING his voice in order to get elected than the fact that he doesn't actually have any strong positions other than getting elected.  Truth is, he's a scare crow made of straw and a corporate puppet.    And let us not forget he supported the Iraq war, despite what he says now.  His voting record in the Senate speaks louder than all his subsequent hand waving and bullsh*t.    How the f*ck can I vote for some b*st*rd that voted for the invasion of Iraq in the face of all the facts we ALL KNEW at that time???  I am certainly no King Bush supporter, but I also must say I'm not a fan of Kerry.  Dean was my man but that's water under the bridge.  He's the lesser of two evils, maybe.  But even there I'm not sure.    A lot of my friends say "Anyone is better than Bush".  And on the surface that sounds right.  But it was that same thinking that got Hitler and Mussolini elected.  And Kerry is NOT a good man.  Not only is he inept, he's also in the pocket of big business Corporate America (and Global business for that matter).  Just look at his campaign funding record if you don't agree.  It's not which party is in office that matters as much as how much they cater to big business pressures.  I honestly don't know which is going to be worse.  He's a man completely without principles.  When has he EVER taken a stand on ANYTHING?  And even when he did, did it last?  I'd also like to know who he's likely to drag into the administration with him?  The people running his campaign?  Probably but let's hope not.  They are an inept bunch that talk out of five sides of their mouths.  And let's know forget his favorite big corporate contributors.  I'd say it's going to smell a lot like the Bush white house.  Let's face it, it was corporate interests that got us into Iraq, wasn't it?  America is run by corporations.  And Kerry may be even MORE of a puppet to them than Bush.  Think about THAT!  Although the article didn't say it directly, it is consistent with my view that we're either going to have a piece of cr*p or sh*t in office next year.  Take your pick which is which, I don't think it matters a lot.  Without a democratic congress nothing is going to change.  Kerry is a flip-flop big-money-talks guy and he's going to sign almost any legislation the congress cranks out... then change his mind after it's too late  .  But I'm even thinking he might be WORSE than Bush for what he causes to happen in his wake.  He doesn't have the charisma to talk congress into anything or persuade the American people to get behind a cause.  And since he's NOT a leader with big ideas that he stands behind there won't be a national agenda anyway.  That will help usher in MORE republican congressmen in subsequent years and a republican president with a big mandate will get elected for the following term.  And why is this all happening?  Because the Democratic party prefers short term gains over long term good.  They are driven by public opinion polls and getting elected at all cost (Kerry is an prime example) rather than on supporting candidates who stand behind their PRINCIPLES and make the right vote even if it means losing the next election.  I'm disheartened.  Pat

      I found the following article in today's Washington Post by Pakistan's General Musharraf to be inspiring:   urlLink http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A5081-2004May31.html   Here's a copy of the article in text form (in case you don't want to bother with the free registration  urlLink www.washingtonpost.com ):   A Plea for Enlightened Moderation    Muslims must raise themselves up through individual achievement and socioeconomic emancipation.    By Pervez Musharraf Tuesday, June 1, 2004; Page A23    The world has been going through a tumultuous period since the dawn of the 1990s, with no sign of relief in sight. The suffering of the innocents, particularly my brethren in faith -- the Muslims -- at the hands of militants, extremists and terrorists has made it all the more urgent to bring order to this troubled scene. In this spirit, I would like to set forth a strategy I call Enlightened Moderation.   The world has become an extremely dangerous place. The devastating power of plastic explosives, combined with high-tech remote-controlled devices, as well as a proliferation of suicide bombers, has created a lethal force that is all but impossible to counter. The unfortunate reality is that both the perpetrators of these crimes and most of the people who suffer from them are Muslims. This has caused many non-Muslims to believe wrongly that Islam is a religion of intolerance, militancy and terrorism. It has led increasing numbers of people to link Islam to fundamentalism; fundamentalism to extremism, and extremism to terrorism. Muslims can protest however vigorously they like against this kind of labeling, but the reality is that such arguments are not likely to prevail in the battle for minds. To make things even more difficult, Muslims are probably the poorest, most uneducated, most powerless and most disunited people in the world.   The stark challenge that faces anyone with compassion for the common heritage of mankind is determining what legacy we will leave for future generations. The special challenge that confronts Muslims is to drag ourselves out of the pit we find ourselves in, to raise ourselves up by individual achievement and collective socioeconomic emancipation. Something has to be done quickly to stop the carnage in the world and to stem the downward slide of Muslims.   My idea for untangling this knot is Enlightened Moderation, which I think is a win for all -- for both the Muslim and non-Muslim worlds. It is a two-pronged strategy. The first part is for the Muslim world to shun militancy and extremism and adopt the path of socioeconomic uplift. The second is for the West, and the United States in particular, to seek to resolve all political disputes with justice and to aid in the socioeconomic betterment of the deprived Muslim world.   We need to understand that the root cause of extremism and militancy lies in political injustice, denial and deprivation. Political injustice to a nation or a people, when combined with stark poverty and illiteracy, makes for an explosive mix. It produces an acute sense of hopelessness and powerlessness. A nation suffering from these lethal ills is easily available for the propagation of militancy and the perpetration of extremist, terrorist acts. It is cannon fodder in a war of terrorism.   I would be remiss if, in defense of the people of my faith, I did not trace the genesis of the Muslims' being labeled as extremists or terrorists. Before the anti-Soviet Afghan war, the sole cause of unrest and concern in the Muslim world was the Palestine dispute. It was this issue that led to a unity of Muslims -- in favor of Palestinians and against Israel. The Afghan war of the 1980s, supported and facilitated by the West as a proxy war against the Soviet Union, saw the emergence and nurturing of pan-Islamic militancy. Islam as a religion was used to harness worldwide Muslim support. Subsequently the atrocities and ethnic cleansing against Muslims in Bosnia, the Chechen uprising, the Kashmir freedom struggle and the invigorated Palestinian intifada all erupted in the '90s after the Soviet disintegration. To make matters worse, the militancy that was sparked in Afghanistan -- which should have been defused after the Cold War -- was instead allowed to fester for a decade.   During this time, hostility among fighters from the Muslim world turned multidirectional, seeking new conflict zones in places where Muslims were suffering. Enter the birth of al Qaeda. Meanwhile, the Palestinian intifada kept gathering momentum, uniting and angering Muslims across the globe. And then came the bombshell of Sept. 11, 2001, and the angry reaction of the United States against the Taliban and al Qaeda in Afghanistan. All subsequent reactions of the United States -- its domestic responses against Muslims, its attitude toward Palestine and the operation in Iraq -- led to total polarization of the Muslim masses against the United States. It is not Islam as a religion that has created militancy and extremism but rather political disputes that have led to antagonism among the Muslim masses.   This is all history now. What has been done cannot be undone. But this situation cannot be allowed to fester; a remedy must be found. I call on the West to help resolve these political disputes with justice, as part of a commitment to a strategy of Enlightened Moderation.   When I think of the role of Muslims in today's world, my heart weeps. What we need is introspection. Who are we, what do we as Muslims stand for, where are we going, where should we be headed and how can we reach it? The answers to these questions are the Muslim part of Enlightened Moderation.   We have a glorious past. Islam exploded on the world scene as the flag bearer of a just, lawful, tolerant and value-oriented society. We had faith in human exaltation through knowledge and enlightenment. We exemplified tolerance within ourselves and toward people of other faiths. The armies of Islam did not march forward to convert people by the sword, despite what the perceptions may be, but to deliver them from the darkness through the visible example of their virtues. What better projection can be found of these deeper values of Islam than the personal example of our Holy Prophet (P.B.U.H.), who personified justice, compassion, tolerance of others, generosity of spirit, austerity with a spirit of sacrifice, and a burning desire to make a better world.   Today's Muslim world is distant from all these values. We have been left far behind in social, moral and economic development. We have remained in our own shell and refused to learn or acquire from others. We have reached the depths of despair and despondency. We need to face stark reality. Is the way ahead one of confrontation and militancy? Could this path really lead us back to our past glory while also showing the light of progress and development to the world?   I say to my brother Muslims: The time for renaissance has come. The way forward is through enlightenment. We must concentrate on human resource development through the alleviation of poverty and through education, health care and social justice. If this is our direction, it cannot be achieved through confrontation. We must adopt a path of moderation and a conciliatory approach to fight the common belief that Islam is a religion of militancy in conflict with modernization, democracy and secularism. All this must be done with a realization that, in the world we live in, fairness does not always rule.   The Organization of Islamic Conferences (OIC) is our collective body. We need to infuse new life into it; it is now in a state of near impotence. The OIC must be restructured to meet the challenges of the 21st century, to fulfill the aspirations of the Muslim world and to take us toward emancipation. Forming a committee of luminaries to recommend a restructuring of the OIC is a big step in the right direction. We have to show resolve and rise above self-interest for our common good -- in the very spirit that Islam teaches us.   The world at large and the powers that be must realize that confrontation and force will never bring peace. Justice must be done and be seen to be done. Let it not be said by future generations that we, the leaders of today, took humanity toward the apocalypse.   Gen. Musharraf is president of Pakistan.   © 2004 The Washington Post Company
