      I remember for the 1988 Olympics held in Seoul (pronnounce, soul) Korea, I was completely awestruck to see so many Taek Won Do artists on the field doing their presentation. All choreographed very well. Today I read that the dood responsible for putting that sport into the Olympics and further onto world recognition, was jailed for corruption and bribery charges. Of course many of you readers would be like, yeah is the nature of politics, but in Korea, it's almost near permanent custom (example: it's customary to tip the nurses and doctors for better treatment, old school, but still happens. example: girls/wives being sold to strange people at the cost of their own debt from bribery). Everyone there IS corrupt because once you're in the cycle, you have to play along. Otherwise, you'll loose everytime. In the US, it's more subdued because the population is soo much larger.  Linking to the movie - Last Samurai (tom cruise and all),  I deeply feel that South Korea has lost their identify and are not acting like teenagers ("who am I?"). North Korea being like the bastard son is say "I'll kill everyone and commit suicide if I have to get noticed!". All cultural aspects (movies, music, news, business practice, TV dramas) are all westernized, having a super-sentimental love scene, and hearing Little Kim in the background. Current pop music is also tainted because all the guys have no balls. It's like listening to Michael Jackson doing a Dr Dre number.  In the broad picture, I believe that South Korea is trying to do the right thing. I still have hope, but I get dissappointed by the country almost every week. An example is New Song-do City. I was thinking about going there to help build this city and to live there. The Inchon Airport is expected to traffic 50% of all flights when this city is complete. But as with business practices in that country, it's likely that a few people will goto jail for bribery.  Projecting backwards, my dad at my age graduated with an architecture degree and had a very respectable job. His designs were incorporated into many new villages and cities of the time. But he dropped everything, packed a single suitcase, gathered all his cash, and came here to start completely over. For me, it's almost impossible for me to do that sicne I've already started my career track. To drop this and goto a different country (without knowing the language) takes some balls to do. My mom did the same thing as with many other koreans of the time. Doing some analysis, I'm glad that I'm here instead of Korea. although part of me will regret the awesome developments happening over there, I'll be miles away from the corruption that breeds there. The fresh immigrants today or FOBs (fresh off the boat) all have that corruption and it divides the korean amerian societies here.  Another disappointment is the Korean army. A recent Korean law states that any male between 18-35  who are of Korean decent must report to the Korean Army regardless of citizenship. As the story goes, a Korean male (US born) in the US army was pulled from his company to go serve in the Korean army. Absoluetly insane.  Ok, I'll stop there. I hope the US and S. Korean teams kick ass. Don't ask me to pick between the two.

      I'm been working with the imagecreatefromjpeg function and a weird thing happens. There are some jpg images that view fine in the browser but does not when using a simple imagecreatefromjpeg script.   // jpegtest.php // use as jpegtest.php?imagename=[filename]  header("Content-type: image/jpeg"); $im = imagecreatefromjpeg($_GET['imagename']); imagejpeg($im); imagedestroy($im); ?

      First blog entry. I guess it's nice to have it. I've tried other places, but I guess if I get Googled (search engine, email, orkut), it can be thought of as an investement. Google is looking for people with PhDs so, I guess I could be right about this
