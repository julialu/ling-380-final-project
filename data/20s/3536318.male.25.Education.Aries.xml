      I find this  urlLink blog  randomly last night... Made me cry. ;)   I concur  As  urlLink Paul notes , we had a difficult meeting at church Sunday night. I was there partly because some friends talked us into seeing Shrek 2 with them, so we never made it home to Mebane in the afternoon, but also because I wanted to be there with Paul, since it involved him to some extent, and I was afraid it was going to get ugly. In my past experience, usually when something threatens to get ugly, even within a church congregation, it does. I was very pleasantly surprised. No one cast harsh or undue blame, and no one used the occasion to build him/herself up or to tear others down. I have to give a lot of credit to our pastors for setting the right tone and saying the right things, but also to the congregation (at least those who were present) for respecting the pastors enough to listen to them and recognize that they spoke the truth. I told Paul how surprised I was at the amicability of the whole evening and he said "That's why I love this church." And as much as I miss some of the liturgy and traditions of the Lutheran church, I've never seen a Lutheran congregation so serious about treating their brothers and sisters as God requires.

      But in a good way.    All I can say is: What a weekend.  I realized the other day that within a week of arriving in Madrid, I found full time work, I got a part in a play, and I was meeting new people left and right.    Talk about jumping in the deep end.  I skipped 2nd, 3rd, and 4th gear and went straight to 5th.  120mph (19 meters).  And it all came to a flourishing climax within the last week.  My play started last weekend.  And it went wonderfully.  (Did you know that in Spain, they don't say 'Break a leg!'?  Instead, they say, "Mucha Mierda"  - A lot of shit. Hah. Those goobers.)  We gave 4 performances, all of which had a great turn out, even the matinee.  Afterwards, although I was extremely happy and grateful to have had the experience, I was also looking forward to all of the sleep I would finally be catching up on.  No more 7AM to 1AM days...     But, I wasn't off the hook that easy.  Most of my classes end on June 30th, so this week I was preparing practice exams, teaching an insane amount of hours in Intensive Courses, and whatnot.  So, by Friday afternoon, I was ready to finally let loose.    My roommate Kelly left for a 2 month visit back in the US on Saturday, and my other roommate, Juan, is moving out on the 30th, moving onwards to Barcelona.  And what does that mean?  One hell of a going away party for those silly bastards...  Unfortunately, by 9PM on Friday, the apartment was a mess, Juan was asleep in his room, Kelly had come down with Strep throat, and no party-supplies had been bought.  So, Kelly basically told me that the party was off.  :(  But there's always something to do in Madrid.  Always.  The director of my show, and my friend, Schuyler (Pronounced: Skippy), was acting in a few one acts in a small theater in Lavapies (Direct Translation: Wash Your Feet [I'm not lying either]) So I met up with a few friends, and we headed off to the theater.   Kelly and I have pretty much the same group of friends, very loquacious friends.  So it was no surprise to find myself approached by quite a few people after the show, asking about the party. And I was the lucky sap that got to tell them all that there would be no Fiesta-val in our apartment that night.  So we went out anyways.  We all headed out to a bar, stood around, drinking cañas, eating tapas, shooting the poo.  Once again, there's never a lack of things to do in Madrid, so it wasn't long before I heard news of other parties lurking in the hidden corners of the city.  Zoë, me, and some other friends decided to go to a Warehouse Birthday party in Sol.  (There are warehouses in the center of Madrid?)  But we decided not to leave for the party until around 1AM. (The party started at 11, but we all know that people don't start showing until 12.  And we wanted to be the fashionably late posse that paraded in at 1.)  So, we rushed to get to the "warehouse" by 1, because they only sent someone down every 1/2 and hour, to open the door for the newcomers.  It turned out that it was far from a warehouse, but more like a large office space that had been abandoned, and was taken over by a group of party crazed Spaniards armed with spraypaint.  It was good and all, but by 3AM, I was pretty pooped, so I headed back to Pappy's farm for some sleep.  And as I'm turning down my windy, cobble stoned, abandoned street, which I expect to be tranquil and serene at this hour, I can't help but notice the familiar sounds of House Techno Music blaring from some apartment.  And as I walk further down the hill, the music only gets louder and louder and louder.  So, as I turned the corner, and came into view of my apartment, it was no surprise to see it lit up light a Christmas tree, and people hanging out in droves on my balconies.  Joder.  So much for sleeping this off.  It turns out that where there is a will, there is a way.  They decided around 11 o'clock, right around when a friend of Juan's showed up with all of his DJ equipment, that they might as well have the damn party.  So they hit up the tavern across the street (No, they didn't jump, they walked) and bought a few bottles.  In fact, they made quite a few trips back there by the time I showed up.  It was a good scene. Loud but decent music, a good vibe, good people.  Might as well screw sleeping.  Not like I had a choice anyways, the DJ was using my room to set up his tables, boxes of records and whatnot.  But by 5AM, my body was running on fumes, and it looked like the guests were nowhere near quitting.  Probably thanks to the assistance of that friendly white powder that I refuse to partake in.  Thankfully, Kelly, let me crash in her bed for 2 hours, that is, until she finally ran out of steam and wanted to sleep in her own bed as well.    So, a little blurry eyed, I wandered back out to the salon, and sat there half asleep, and half astonished that these guys were still going strong.    I shook my head, went to the chicken, I mean kitchen, made some breakfast, read the paper (from January), and awaited for that long lost sound of silence.  (As were my neighbors, I’m sure)    My wish was granted around 9:30AM, when the boys and girls took off for some other recreational activities, like cooking breakfast for the homeless or something.  Kelly awoke soon after, and we sat up chatting, accompanied by our well rested friend, and soon-to-be new roommate, Lance.  Around noon, I held back the tears and said farewell to the coolest roommate I’ve ever had named Kelly.  Now, por fin, with the apartment to myself, and a bed calling my name, I made my way to my room, picked out a movie to fall asleep to, popped it in my laptop, turned to volume to a moderate level, as not to piss off the neighbors even more, jumped in my bed, crawled under my comforter, fluffed my pillow, and......and….and, right then….  Juan came home with the troops.  No big deal I though, who knows, maybe they might even start cleaning up.  Yeah, good luck there Paul.  Nope, within 10 minutes, they had the tables spinning again, and the music pumping at entirely inappropriate levels.  What are they, deaf or something!  (haha, I sound like such an old fart)  Soooo, I raised up the white flag, dragged myself out of bed, and joined the party.  If you can’t beat ‘em, might as well join ‘em and look at them funny until they get the hint.  No, actually, by this time, all hope for sleep was shot, so, I forced myself to wake up. I grabbed my book (Dune) and sat in Kelly’s room reading for most of the afternoon.    Until The Phone Call.     From my Landlord.   Felix.  You see, the contract (lease) for the year finishes on the 30th of June, and Kelly and I agreed that we’d take over the contract.  The only problem is Felix lives in Malaga, and only comes up to Madrid once a month.  And today was that day.  So I get on the horn with him, and set up a meeting with him around 5PM, at the apartment.  The apartment that as of right now is RaveFest 2004.    I explained the situation to Juan, and begged him to wrap up the party in the next few hours.  At least by 4:30, giving me enough time to clean up the living room.  So, I spent the rest of the afternoon cleaning the rooms that weren’t teeming with cracked-out clubbers, and gently reminding the memory-challenged Juan about the meeting.    At the beginning, he said it would be no problem. Around 3 o’clock, he suggested that maybe I should take him to coffee instead of inviting up to the apartment that he owns.. Around 4:30, he came up with the brilliant idea of possibly inviting this 40 something year old landlord to join the party for a beer or two.  Yes, the face that you’re probably making as of reading that last brilliant idea is pretty much what my expression was for the rest of the afternoon.     Lance came over around then, and we agreed that this is not our fault. I’d tried my best, and the landlord has no choice but to accept that, and be grateful that he’s getting rid of Einstein over there, who as of then was trying his best not to drool on himself.  Turns out that all the fretting I had done in the last few hours was for not.  Felix was a really cool guy, he understood the situation perfectly.  He handed us the contract, got our signatures, gave us our signed copy, and said farewell.  Freaking piece of cake man.  It also turns out that Felix had great timing as well.  As he was leaving the front of the apartment, an older gentleman approached him, The Community President.  A very surly Community President.  Seems he had a few things to say about Juan’s little soirée, and if we didn’t cease and desist, we’d not only be thrown out of the apartment, but the community.  Half of me wished that would happen just to say I’ve been kicked out of a community at one time in my life.  But, I weighed my options, and come to the conclusion that I’m happy living here, so I might as well do what I can to stop it.   Around 10PM, the remaining boys (Juan, Joseph the DJ, and David) turned off the music and followed me to a pre-party at my friend Mercedes’ house, in the hopes that they could meet some virtuous young ladies.  Of course, it’s hard to be suave when you have the mental capacity of a hamster.  So at 12, we bid the boys adieu and a group of us headed off to another party.  I was pleasantly surprised to finally be at a party where the people were actually talking about normal things, rather than trading advice on the most effective ways to roll dollar bills.  I spent most of the night hanging out with Joey, a 30 year old Osteopath/Mechanic from Iceland who learned English just so he had an excuse to use our swears.  This guy had a worse mouth than an Australian.  But he was a great guy, twisted, but a good guy.  He even did some work on my extremely screwed up back, and offered me a free session.    I got conned into joining the group in an excursion to some far off bar, and was thanking any deity listening when the bar closed 15 minutes later at 3.  Having damn good reason for being tired, I didn’t feel bad at all for saying adios to the troops, and gross-motor-ambulating home.    And as I turned down my windy, cobble stoned, abandoned street once again, I smiled as I walked the rest of the way home in complete silence.  Granted, when I walked in my apartment, I wasn’t surprised to see a few people there.  The DJ was asleep on the couch (thank god), David was asleep in Kelly’s room, and Juan and Nacho were hanging out in the kitchen with 2 American friends.    I smiled, introduced myself, joked around about sleep deprivation, and wished them all a good night.  They nodded in agreement, and handed me a glass of wine as a sign that they would allow such an incredulous activity.  My willpower shot, and unable to speak enough Spanish to argue, I gave in and pulled up a chair.    It was a good craic though… I spoke a decent amount of Spanish (Si, no, si, no, si, si), snuck in a few conversations in English with Sonia while they weren’t paying attention, and had a political debate with Nacho and Sonia (In Spanish) until 7AM.  Side note: Spanish people are impossible to have debates with.  They love to talk, and they only listen long enough to hear something they can either agree with or contradict.  (Usually about 5 words into your turn to talk)  Of course, if you’re Spanish, and you’re reading this now, of course I’m not talking about you.    Oh yeah.. and I’m going to start doing Yoga.  Joey, the osteopath, recommended it for my back, so I figure, “Why the hell not!”    So that’s my weekend.  I’ll be surprised if you actually read all of this blabbing.  It’s mostly for me to remember when I’m old and reminiscent and drooling on myself.   I’ll have to ask Juan for some tips on that last one before he takes off.

      Now, normally I don't set aside much sympathy for criminals, especially the felons who are found guilty of the unmentionable crimes, like the group of people that get on the Metro at one end of the line, take up all the available seats, and remain seated there until the other end of the line, making it certain that no one, me especially, will ever ever find a place to rest their bones.  Ok, back to the random thought.  The one time I really do feel bad for them, is if the police raids their house/apartment/flat/whatever while they're halfway through shaving. I mean, they're not going to wait there until he finishes shaving the left side of his face, no, they'll drag his foamy ass to the curb.  He'll have the goofiest mug shot of all the other cons.  He'll probably be made someone's bitch the first night in the can, just out of principle.  See, that's why I don't break the law.  I have this deeply rooted fear that if I were to get caught for it, that's probably how it would go down. Yeah, I know it's an irrational fear, because we all know that I can't even grow a beard.   I just get fuzzy.

      I'm having a wierd time getting this commenting system to work.  Half the time, when you click on the "comment" button, it will open up a pop-up-window, and let you comment with the HaloScan program.  The other half of the time, people are still able to comment using the Blogger Commenting System...    If you're reading this, could you please leave a comment to see if this thing works. And/Or if you have any experience with this wacky coding, do you have any advice?  I'm going to be a man on this one, and refuse to read the directions that the HaloScan website gave me.    And make all your comments sweet as pie.  I need some trans-atlantic lovin...

      The clock has has finally learned how to use links, and it's found it's way to my blog!  Yeah!!!

Accept it)    Resistance is futile...

      A few of you have informed me that posting a comment in Blogger is more difficult than getting a refund from a heroine dealer. (I didn't think twice about that analogy the first time someone told me, after the 4th time, I'm beginning to wonder about my target audience.)  So, I've gone and made the commenting process as quick and painless as possible.  So... Make me feel special and leave me a message.    Just don't go asking me if I could lend you $20 for an "emergency appointment" with your "doctor".

      As everyone knows, today is el Dia de San Juan. Well, to be honest, I'm assuming that you all know about this special day because I've always known about it.  That is, if you consider "always" to be around 10 o'clock this morning when Glenda, a fellow professor, invited me to her and her husbands house to join them in celebrating this lovely day. Here's the gist of the day: Gather with friends Eat lots o' food Drink lots o' wine Make a fire and burn stuff (What is it with Spaniards and Fire???)  Actually, there's a very special meaning behind all that "burning stuff".  You're supposed to take a piece of paper, and write a few wishes on it.  Things you want to leave behind, things that the fire will burn away (metaphorically).  Or things you want, i.e.: a million dollars.  And when you wake up in the morning, and you look under your pillow, you'll be surprised to find........ nothing, because San Juan isn't made of money like our parents always were when we were kids.  No, these wishes are basically resolutions and hopes for the next year.  And then to show that you have the determination/courage to change the things you want to change, or the intestinal fortitude to follow the dreams you seek, you must jump over the fire.... many times...   God, I love Spanish culture.    So, there I was, half an hour outside of Madrid, in the Spanish countryside.  Not a building or streetlight to be seen for miles.  And about 12 of us sat around the fire, in Glenda's backyards, under the clear night sky, cheering on each other as we jumped.  I whipped out the guitar and serenaded the folk.  They actually were impressed that an American could play Spanish music!  Afterwards, I lent my guitar to a senorita at the party, and she and another woman sang us some traditional Spanish music.  After we made sure that everyone had gotten a chance to jump (aka: forced if they were being timid), Glenda gave us all a bunch of Rosemary to throw on the fire.  It was amazing to see the tremendous amount of reverence each person gave to the power of the flame.  Every slip of paper and every twig of rosemary were gently placed into the heaving flames.  Every single one of us stopped and stared into the red coals and flickering flames, as we pondered what we just asked for...  Respect for the fire...  As I was getting a ride back into the city,  I realized that this was the first time in 6 months that I had been out in the countryside as opposed to the city or en-route to another city on a bus/train/etc.  Damn, I need to get out of the city more... No, first, I need to find a friend with a car... hehehe.    Also, if you're every get the feeling that you don't get out of the house much, let alone the country, just get in your car, or a friend's car, and drive on the highway at night.  I don't care what country you're in, but as long as you can't see beyond those 3 lanes, street lights, and roadside McDonald's, at 1AM, they all look the same.  I swear, at times, I felt like I was getting a ride back into Hartford.  As long as I didn't pay attention to the signs written in Spanish, I could swear I'd see Sisson Ave. coming up on the left at any moment.  So, try it next time you're out and about.  Impress your friends!  Tell them you were just in Hungary, or Galway, or Denmark, or all three!  Let me know how you're travels go, and how many continents you can hit up in one night.  And yes, even the overwhelming amount of construction is the same in other countries.

      Ok... I have a new idea for the blog.  After living in Madrid for 3 months, I've come up with quite a list of all that is good, bad, and ugly here.   Now, I remember a conversation I had awhile ago with my friend Shazde(h) who remarked how wonderful it was to hear me talking about all the good/warm/and fuzzy things I was observing about the places I was visiting. Thankfully not doing what most other do, by remarking on all the things that aren’t normal – therefore – bad.   But I’ve lived here long enough damnit, and now I can start griping.  So folks, this is how it’ll go:    "The Good"   will be about everything I've come to love about this city.  It's people, it's places, it's odd little quirks...     "The Bad"   will be about all the… ummmmmm… Bad... uh, that I see... The stuff that Paul no likey.   "The Ugly"   are the things that at one time or another might have been "The Bad" but have evolved exponentially into things/people that can only be summed up as "Those who need to die and start over again."    So, to start this off, I'll hit up a topic that fits into all 3 categories.      Street/Metro Buskers:     The Good:   These street musicians can be enchanting at times. I've stopped and marveled at the one armed classical guitar player in Plaza Mayor who picks at his guitar with his plastic hook.  I've grown to respect the keyboardist who you can find playing in the depths of the Moncloa Metro Station on a daily basis. And the frantic string thwaks of the cimbalom player in Puerta Del Sol leaves my jaw agape.  I even didn't mind the accordion player who graced all of the metro-travelers riding Line 3 with his remarkably soothing playing. Believe it or not, he had the courtesy to play at a reasonably quiet dynamic level. (I always thought that accordions had 2 volume levels, Bagpipish and Beethovenesque.)  Aaaand, on occasion, I even give them money! (I won't say that I always tip them, because that would be an outright lie.  I'm a trustworthy man, a man true to his word, and apparently a cheapskate.)    The Bad:   Ok, so that one accordion player on Line 3 actually impressed me, but the other 1,235,798 other squeeze-boxers are perhaps the most irritating thing in the world.  At first, it was actually kind of endearing.  You know, you're wandering through the side streets of Madrid, and every other block you hear the distinct whine of that demon-spawn instrument "seranading" a group of blonde, glossy-eyed tourists who are drinking their cafe latte in some outdoor cafe.  But after a few days of listening to the guy in the plaza down the street from you play the same damn tunes incessantly, and then hearing a different guy a few blocks away playing the same repertoire, you get tired of it fast.  I personally believe that they all get together on some weeknight, learn the same friggin' 3 songs, and head out to fascinate the moronic tourists, meanwhile giving the rest of us an aneurism.  And to the girl in the Sol Metro Station who stands there singing bad easy-listening songs acapella into her microphone: Stop... Please... For God’s Sake.  There’s a reason that no one is giving you money.  We don’t want to encourage you.    The Ugly:  Anyone, and I repeat, ANYONE who plays Celine Dion’s “My Heart Must Go On” must be shot… multiple times…in the head… or the groin... whatever’s easier to hit…   Oh, and yes, you guessed it.  I   always   tip  these  guys…

      Ok... I'm either going to throw this friggin' computer out the window, or throw it out the window...  It took me AN HOUR just to get to this website.  So, I'm going to spend the rest of the day copying all my crap off this computer, and then I'm reformatting the fucker...  (Pardon my French)  If you've ever had the pleasure of doing this before, you would know that it takes forever and 3 days to complete.  So... If you don't here back from me soon, I'm either still working on it, or I've hung myself with the internet cable. At least it would be doing something useful.

      Something I saw in the metro station reminded me of this one liner. So I'm going to post it.  And since there are plenty of these easy-to-read one liners to go around for awhile, I'll post one every so often to get a smile out of you.   An escalator can never break. It can only become stairs. You would never see an "Escalator Temporarily Out Of Order" sign, just "Escalator Temporarily Stairs. Sorry for the convenience."    and a bonus quote for the day:   I had a bag of fritos, they were texas grilled fritos. These fritos had grill marks on them. Hell yeah, reminds me of something, when we used to fire up the barbeque and throw down some fritos. I can still see my dad with the apron on, better flip that frito, dad, you know how I like mine.   ahhhh. simple pleasures...

      I started reading Michael Moore's "Stupid White Men" this morning.   And it ain't half bad.  It definitely got me thinking about the state of affair that America is in.  Fraudster Politicians, Power Abuse, Adjusting National Policy and Tax Reform to suit the bank accounts of the stinking rich minority, our depressing education system, and our socially perpetuated indifference towards racism, misogyny, and environmental awareness.  And who's to blame for these shortcomings, this downfall of our society?  Men  Mostly of the Stupid and White variety.   Now, Mikey Moore puts forward some convincing arguments.  Statistics, quotes, projections, etc.  It’s enough to make you put down the book every once and awhile and go, "Wow.... We're fucked."  But my mom raised me to be smarter than that.  I recall her telling me about a certain Statistics Class she took during college.  The course book she was required to buy for the class was entitled, "How to Lie using Statistics."  You want to swing statistics in your favor?  It’s easy.  Include only the information that you want to include.  Compare and contrast only the factors that will create the illusion of a drastic difference.  You want to survey people?  Make sure your target group consists mostly of people who have the mentality you're in favor of, or limit the numbers to create a favorable outcome, although wildly inaccurate.  Two people, with opposing positions in regards to a certain debate, could use the exact same information, and yet both of them could produce impressive and convincing arguments for their side.  Presentation, presentation, presentation.  I'm sure that Michael Moore isn't lying, but it's hard to take what he says to heart when he's trying to balance out his opinionated and biased generalizations with a few unelaborated statistics that attempt to make him seem more objective.  Oh, and one more thing.  This Devil that he speaks of, this diabolical monstrosity that is ruining the world around us as we speak.... is ME.  I am the living incarnation of all the traits that make up “The Man.”  All the traits that are considered the “Acceptable Norms”:  I'm Male. I'm White. I'm Hetero-Sexual I'm Middle-Class I'm a Christian I'm not Disabled I don't have a Learning Disability I'm Healthy I'm Literate  When was the last time you saw a Male Chauvinist Club, or a White Power Support Group?  (Well, there is the KKK, but we all know how we feel about THEM) I mean, when was the last time you saw a protest held in support of Hetero-Sexual Equality? It just doesn't happen.  These people, who have embodied these favored traits, have worked HARD to make sure that there will never be a shift of power.  And I'm inherently part of that club.  Well, where do I hand in my resignation?  That's the thing that bothers me about his book.  Although it's definitely tongue-in-cheek part of the time, it is also an all out attack on people like me.  He makes absurd generalizations, stereotypes The Favored constantly, and lumps me into a group of people I wouldn't be caught dead with. And Moore follows up these slanderous remarks with a quirky, humorous anecdote so he can defend himself from any criticism with, "Hey, lighten up! It's Humor! Don't take it personally man!"  Well, that's where difference between humor and objectivity lies.  Yeah, the man can be downright hilarious at times.  But he's also trying to be a revolutionist.  He wants to spread the word, open our eyes, and instill some conviction in our collective apathetic hearts.  Yeah, well Mr. Luther King accomplished the same thing, but without making any, "So did you hear the one about the black seamstress and the bus driver?" jokes.  Sighh... Who knows, maybe he'll include a chapter towards the end entitled, "White People Who Don't Suck".  I hope to God that he does, or else he's just another putz who's playing the "Down with Whitey" card in order to rake in the book sales from the Non-White-Men group.  ‘Cuz let's face it, there's a lot more of them than there are of us.  And always remember: 76.8% of all statistics are made up on the spot...

      I'm proud to say that after 2 1/2(ish) months in Spain, I've become fluent in Spanglish that I could start up my own Spanglish Translation Service.  Hmmmm, that sounds like a GREAT idea!  I'll let you know how it goes.  Spanish, on the other hand, is a tad bit harder to conquer.  But I think it's starting to sink in.  (It's actually - Can Io Haveo Ao BeerA {Beer is feminine}) I've actually reached a point where I can sit and have a semi-intelligent conversation with a Spaniard, and not have to resort to yelling across the room to some friend who speaks Spanish to have them translate a word for me.   ME:  Hola!  Guillermo:  Hola!  ME:  Que tal?  Guillermo:  Bien.  Y tu?  ME:  Bien. Guillermo: Basada en un conjunto internacional de redes enlazadas, Internet ha supuesto la gran revolucion de los medios de comunicacion, ya que ha posibilitado que el mundo se convierta en una autentica aldea global.  Disenada inicialmente con fines militares y usada mas tarde como nexo de union entre centros univesitarios, hoy la Red se ha convertido en un instrumento de trabajo y de ocio al que acuden millones de personas de todo el planeta en busca de informacion, servicios, y diversion.  Me entiendes, no?  ME: (Nodding my head with conviction, squinting my eyes in interest, as if I'm really thinking hard about what he has just said.)    Si.... claro...  Guillermo:  Vale, tengo que ir a mi casa.  ME:  mmmm hmmm.  Guillermo:  Adios!  ME:  Que?  Apart from learning all the swear words in the Spanish language (Priority #1), I've moved onto learning things like, useful verbs (Estar, Ser, Beber, Hola) and some useful phrases like:  1. Me llamo Caballo 2. Hay un cacajuete en mi ombligo 3. Mi hermano es una sandia 4. Se rifa una hostia, y tu tienes todas las papeletas para ganar. and 5. Me entiendes? (I hear this one alot)  Unfortunately, I really need to start putting my nose to the grindstone, and get my Spanish up to a semi-fluent level.  To the point where I can ask for a beer AND ask what kinds they have.  Most of the Spaniards I meet are very patient and encouraging though.  I have one friend who insists on telling all the other Spaniards in the vicinity how well I speak Spanish, seeing as I've only been here for 3 months.  I blush alittle, look down at the floor, kick my foot back and forth a bit, wave my hand in the well known "Awww shucks, stop it" manner, and say, "Nawwwwwwwww." (Thus making a flagrant grammitical error, because, in Spanish, it's "Nawwwwwwwo")  But, with every passing day, I'm getting farther and farther away from elicting the "It's OK that he doesn't speak Spanish, he's only been here (insert relatively small time period)" disposition from people.  It's not so often that you hear someone say, "It's OK that he doesn't speak Spanish, he's only been here 15 years."  So, with that, I'm off to get my learn on.  And if you're one of the people that wants to visit me here, but doesn't speak a lick of Spanish, don't worry, hopefully by the time you come, I'll know how to order a ROUND of beers."  Arrivederci!!!

      Life is good...  They just opened up a tavern across the street from me.  And when I say "across the street", I don't mean it in the "within the proximity of 1/2 a mile" kind of "across the street."  I mean "ACROSS THE STREET" I was really bored the other day, so I figure it all out.    1. The Front door of the tavern is approximately 15 ft infront of my kitchen balcony.  2. My kitchen balcony is approximately 15 feet up above the ground.  3. Now if you apply pythagorium's theorem to this situation a^2 + b^2 = c^2), I have to jump 21.213203435596425732025330863145 ft to get from my balcony to the bar.  BUT.  you don't jump in a straight line, so we'll have to factor in arc.  Considering that the distance between the ground in front of my apartment and the bar is the same as between the ground and my balcony, we'll take that distance (15ft) to be the radius of a quartered circle.  We'll use the Radius (R) and apply it to the formula for circumference: circum=2*pi*R with pi=3.1415926535897932384626433832795028841971693993751  05820974944592307816406286208998628034825342117067  98214808651328230664709384460955058223172535940812  84811174502841027019385211055596446229489549303819  64428810975665933446128475648233786783165271201909  14564856692346034861045432664821339360726024914127  37245870066063155881748815209209628292540917153643  67892590360011330530548820466521384146951941511609  43305727036575959195309218611738193261179310511854  80744623799627495673518857527248912279381830119491   (Yup, we ain't joking around here.  We're going 500 digits deep into PI baby.  We don't want anything short of the most accurate answer. {Even though we've been approximating every other factor up until now})  That gives us a 133.2864881447509874104764297018 ft circumference.  But since we're only dealing with a quarter of the whole, we'll divide it by 4.  The result being: I have to jump 33.32162203618774685261910742545 ft (or 6 liters) to make it from the top railing of my balcony to the bar.  Whoa.. I'm exhausted..  If you're looking for me, I'll be across the street having a beer...  That is, if I survive the landing.

      What a frustrating night...  T-Minus 12 days until opening night of the play, and the main actor has memorized only about 30% of his lines.  Granted 80% of the other lines he vaguely remembers, but that still leaves about 14% of which he doesn't have the faintest chance of remembering.  I'm sorry.  But it's hard to feel the flow of a play while acting opposite him when 70% of the time he is up on stage either dictating his fuzzy lines to himself, or calling out for "line!"  sigh...  And the other actor is an absolute hopeless cause.  I may be reaching here, but based on his method of acting, and the way he chooses to portray his character, which, by the way, varies from rehearsal to rehearsal, that I wouldn't be surprised if he would use Jim Carrey as a model for his interpretation of Hamlet.  (Sorry, had to let that out)  Sooo.. Needless to say, after 3 hours of rehearsal, I left the theater frustrated and annoyed.  And as I'm walking down the street, beginning my 20 minute walk home, I look up in the sky, and it starts to thunder and lightning.  It's a damn good thing I love thunderstorms, or else I would think that someone up there had a twisted sense of humor. (Hey, at least it's not raining!)  But I think that Madrid was just giving me something to calm my soul.  It continued to thunder and lightning (an impressive show I might add) throughout my commute home, yet it chose not to start the rain.    So instead of going home, I walk a block or so away past my house, to the Segovia Bridge, to watch the show.    And I'm standing there, leaning up against a light post, smoking a cigarette, looking over the west end of Madrid, admiring the light show, just trying to forget about the last few hours.   As I'm standing there, I look over for a second to see a young couple walking across the bridge towards me.  And right before it starts to rain, as they're about to walk past me, the girl walks up to me, hands me a beautiful white flower, smiles, and says, "Para ti." and then walks away with her boyfriend.  And I just stood there, admiring the beauty of the flower, and the beauty of the sequence of events that just occured as well.  Oblivious to the lightning that held my attention so dear just a few minutes ago.  And then it started raining.    Cue exit.  Onwards to home.  Thank you Madrid.

      It's nice to be back in the theater.   The other day, after 2 months of rehearsals, I finally remembered why I like being on a stage.  Acting is a thrilling art.  You get the chance to ignore all your inhibitions for a few hours, and just follow what your gut says.  Hell, if I had the talent, I'd consider being an actor, like my brother...  That is, if it weren't for the other actors.  There are four actors in my play (The Goat, by Edward Albee): My friend Zoe, who is an amazing actress and an amazing person to boot.  But the other two... oooooooh the other two.  Some people just need to die and start over.  That's the best way to put it.   The pompousness, the arrogance, the facades, the lies, the impenitrable ego, etc etc... I cannot begin to tell you how remarkably oblivious they can be when it comes down to acknowledging reality.    Have you ever heard someone say something SOOOO incredibly absurd that you just stand there for a few seconds, your mouth hanging in disbelief, and then feel compelled to slap them upside the head, grab them by the shoulders and while vigorously shaking them with the utmost sincerity, scream, "What the hell is the matter with you!?"  You have?  Well, take that situation, duplicate it a few dozen times, and line them up one after another. And then you'll know what it's like to spend 30 minutes with these two.  Thank God I know people like my brothers, sister, Zoe, Sarah, Shawn, etc to assure me that not all actors are that thick.

      Ok...  Someone needs to teach these Madrilenos how to walk.  Seriously.  I'm not joking.  People in Madrid just DON'T KNOW HOW TO WALK!!!  Scenario 1: I'm walking down the sidewalk, on my way to catch the metro in Puera De Sol, and there's a man/woman walking directly towards me, on their way to God knows where. In the hopes that they won't have to exert any extra energy by acknowleding my oncoming presence and moving slightly to the left, they mentally close their eyes and continue walking.   Now, being the Gentleman that I am, I usually move aside well before collision, leaving them to continue on un-exerted, and, so I'd like to think, thanking me quietly for not making them deviate from their predestined path to their destination. This is fine most of the time, like when there's light traffic on the sidewalk, but when the teeming millions are out to wander aimlessly throughout Madrid, sometimes alittle effort is needed by everybody involved.  Especially if it means that I must dodge into moving traffic to let them have their way.  Scenario 2: The Lost Causes FOPs - AKA The Elders.   I'm sorry.  But there's no helping these people.  If there is a line of geriatrics coming down the sidewalk, obviously leaving no room to sneak by, you're better off just throwing yourself up against the wall, sucking in your stomach, and hoping that by the time they pass, you will survive un-caned.    We need to get Senorita Manners out here... These people are killing me.  I got so excited today when I did the little side walk dance with someone.  You know what I mean.  You both actually try to be the curtious ones, and end up side-stepping in the same direction.  And then, again, side stepping in the other direction.  I swear, the next time that happens, I'm going to grab their hand, twirl them around, say "Thanks for the dance!" and keep walking.  Hey, at least they acknowledged my presence, that's a good enough reason to dance.  Note: Extensive research has been done to find a word to describe this dance.  Here's what they've come up with so far:   Shuggleftulation Sidewaltz Minueticate Doing the concrete quadrille Awkstepping Avoidancing Faux pas de deux   There.  You've learned something new today.  Useless knowledge is the best.  Choose your favorite one, and impress all of your friends.  You can thank me later.

      When I said I was teaching English in Madrid, I wasn't lying.  But it's not the conventional kind of teaching that you would think of when someone says "  Hey, I'm a teacher.  "  My classrooms are far from the classrooms we had when we were little runts in highschool pretending to learn Spanish.  Large, bulletin board infested rooms with a haze of chalk dust in the air.  No.  My classrooms are personal offices and conference rooms.  Since all of my students are professional business-people, I go to them, they don't come to me.  So I get to know quite alot of Madrid en-route to these business'.  Or, at least I get to know the metrolines rather well, and can now remember if I've been in a subway car based on the fine graffiti you can find within them.   So, needless to say, I spend about as much time commuting between offices as I do teaching in them.   And that gives me  alot  of time to stare blankly into thin air.  Not wanting to watch my brain atrophy into a lump of pudding, I've started to engage in the fine art of people-watching. So... I'll use this fine blog-space to publish all the random not-so-deep thoughts that pass through my dome in these times of quiet meditation.  God Bless you for actually reading this...

      Someone wrote a comment the other day... Someone I don't know personally... Someone I don't even think my friends or family know personally...  That can only mean one thing...  Someone besides my sister and my brother read this trash!!!  To make it even cooler: Someone I don't even know!  I suppose I better step up the pace of these blog entries... Yes.. Ok.. and step up the quality of them too.  I have a public to entertain!!!   (Oh, and if you know the guy, and it turns out he's actually my best friend from home, don't tell me just yet... I'm living in my own dream world.  urlLink Marie  has  urlLink MPERIA  and the #1 slot,  urlLink Chris  has the Writer that wants him to review his book,  urlLink Mike  has been seen by millions on the silver screen, I have some guy from Canada who stumbled upon my blog.)

        (This one's for my sis (and my entire fam damily), cuz I'm now writing to make sure at least 1 person will come here everyday to see if I've written anything.&nbsp;     Romantic Movies Are Ruining Society    Ok... as I mentioned in my last entry, I was hard up for new movies to watch, so my roommate lent me "Bridget Jones' Diary".&nbsp; Then a few days later, while temporarily insane, I borrowed "Notting Hill".&nbsp; Then a few days later, as if I hadn't had enough, I watched "Love Actually" after my roommates purchased it at the Rastro.   The one thing I did get out of it, other than the urge to throw up all over the place, was an urge to throw up all over the place.&nbsp; No really, I began to worry about all the poor saps that watch these movies, and base their perception of love on them.   Ok - First off - Let me sum up EVERY Chick Flick ever made.   1. Boy Meets Girl  2. The either love or hate each other  3. Somewhere down the line, they "fall in love", and one, or both, of them must either overcome some absurd obstacle in order to be with the one they "love" or they must give up something, ie: the pursuit of their passion(s) in life, just to make it work out between the two of them.  4. They kiss  5. Movie Ends  6. I throw up.   What kills me about all of these movies, is that you have all these couples running around, rearranging their lives, just to be with someone their infatuated/in lust with.&nbsp; And that plain pissed me off.&nbsp; I mean, the guy who decides to go to a different/inferior college to be with his sweety, or the girl who quits her job to run away with some guy.&nbsp; For God's sake!&nbsp; I know you may hate your job, and I know you don't think a change in college will mean anything, but do you need to have someone else to give you the reason to do it?&nbsp;   When you put your fate in the hands of a almost perfect stranger who you have a thing for, you're just asking for trouble.&nbsp; I always wish these DVD's had an option called: See how our lovely couple is doing a year from now.&nbsp;   Is that boy who opted for an inferior college still with his sweetheart?&nbsp; Or is she now sleeping with his roommate? While he's recieving a weak education?&nbsp; And he sits there and spites her for "making" him come there?&nbsp;   Or the girl who ran off with her beau...&nbsp; Did he run off with some harlot that he met in a club? Is she now stranded 1000's of miles away from home with no friends or family near?&nbsp;   Ok, ok, ok.&nbsp; I know.&nbsp; Great things could come out of these situations.&nbsp; Boy #1 decides to give up on the whole love issue, and start focusing on his education.&nbsp; Since the school isn't doing such a wonderful job, he decides to take matters into his own hands, and start a social club for his major - Basket Weaving.&nbsp; After awhile, the group has a strong base membership, and they're learning more outside of the classroom than in.&nbsp; And one day, he's walking out of the meeting with the  rest of the students, and one of the girls in the group trips and falls over a stray length of wicker.&nbsp; She's twisted her ankle and she can't walk, so he takes her back up to her dorm, she invited him to stay for a coffee, because he's a hero, and they end up being soul-mates, getting married, having 2 1/2 kids, a dog, and a house with a white picket fence.&nbsp; Woohoo!&nbsp; Great!!!!!!!!   Or Girl #1.&nbsp; She could be taking a walk through the mountains alone, because she has no one to hang out with, and no money to spend in the town.&nbsp; She walks up to the edge of the cliff, peering out over the countryside, pondering the meaning of life.&nbsp; She looks over to her right to see a man with an easel, that she hadn't noticed before, painting the landscape.&nbsp; They exchange shy "hello"'s, and she asks to see his painting.&nbsp; It turns out that he's incredibly talented, and she's deeply moved by his work.&nbsp; When she was younger, she used to paint, but she gave that up for fun and partying back in the day.&nbsp; But now, she has a renewed sense of purpose, and she asks him to teach her.&nbsp; So they spend the next few months painting together, never really initiating anything. But after awhile, they've become great friends.&nbsp; Before you know it, they're having paint fights, and painting portraits of the other while in each others absence.&nbsp; One day, in the midst of a paint fight turned wrestling match, they're both lying on the ground, intertwined, they look in each others eyes, stop laughing, realize they're in love with each other, kiss.&nbsp; Eternal happiness ensues.   Wonderful.&nbsp; Good things can come out of bad situations.&nbsp; But the thing that bothers me, is what it took to get there. They compromised something of themselves for something that wasn't worth the effort.&nbsp; Yeah, so they ended up doing ok in the end, but does that mean that something equally as great wouldn't have happened if they hadn't had blundered in the beginning?&nbsp;   Here's my opinion.&nbsp; Some people spend their whole lives prioritizing finding the "one".&nbsp; When they're in work, school, the bar, on the street, they're thinking about which one could be it.&nbsp; I think we've all done it at one time or another.&nbsp; People go around to anywhere, looking for any type of person that at least fills their idea of "satisfactory" AKA: a large percentage of the sex you're attracted to.&nbsp; But satisfactory only works for the "puppy dog love" stage of the relationship.&nbsp; Where everything is still fresh and new - a fantasy.&nbsp; But give it a few months, and that satisfactory person turns out to not be worth the long haul.&nbsp;   So you try again.&nbsp; and again.&nbsp; and again...&nbsp;   Where are you going wrong???&nbsp; Why do you keep meeting the short-termers???   Because you're looking in the wrong places.&nbsp;   Step 1: Forget about finding love.&nbsp; We'll worry about that later  Step 2: Start thinking about yourself.&nbsp; What are your passions, your interests.&nbsp; The things that make you feel alive when you do them.&nbsp; Music?&nbsp; Art?&nbsp; Running?&nbsp; Breathing?  Step 3: Pursue that passion.&nbsp; A job, join a group, start a club, attend meetings and conventions, take a class, whatever.  Step 4: If you've stayed true to that path, the path of your passion, then your chances of finding that special someone, who's path is similar to yours, is incredibly higher if you follow those rules.&nbsp;   That means, give up the bar and clubs.&nbsp; Sociopaths, murders, and gym teachers like going to bars too.&nbsp;   And yes, following this love-plan could take you 1,000's of miles from home, or to a different college, or job... But the point is that you're doing it for yourself.&nbsp; You're taking the risk to better yourself.&nbsp; What could be better than that!&nbsp; You see, these movies are blinding the public to what real love is.&nbsp; Yeah, so the joining of two people under unreal circumstances can be fun to watch, but wake up and forget that nonsense.&nbsp; I really hope that people don't put stock in these ideas of love.   There should be more movies about true love, love already established, unconditional love that has to overcome the odds.&nbsp; Now that's real life.&nbsp; Granted, it may not always include gun fights or alien abductions, but it's real life.&nbsp; People who've found their "one" will have to overcome the odds at one time or another.&nbsp; There could come a time when it's possible that one will have to give up something of themselves, even their lives, to be with or save the one they love. Even if the circumstances are unreal, at least the motives behind their actions are.  &nbsp;  One could only hope.   Someone call Hollywood and slap them upside the head for me.

      Well, I'm at the point that everyday my laptop can turn on, I'm happy.&nbsp; Ahhhh, the little things in life that make me smile.   Seems that my computer is on it's way to being kaput.&nbsp; At first it started when I was watching DVD's.&nbsp; About an hour or so into the movie, the fan would kick into high, everything would stop for a second, and the computer would turn completely off.&nbsp;   So I'd turn it back on, start the movie where I was a few minutes ago, watch 10 more minutes, and then it would shut down again.&nbsp;   It reached&nbsp;the&nbsp;point where I was ready to throw it out the window when I was hard up for a new movie to watch, so my roomie lent me "Bridget Jones' Diary" AKA: The sappiest craptastic piece of poop ever filmed.&nbsp; Well, I'm exagerrating, but my computer kept shutting down every 15 minutes or so.&nbsp; And then I'd have to spend 10 minutes waiting for it to start up and settle down again before I could resume watching it.&nbsp; Now, after the 6th time it shut down, I'd seen enough to know that I wouldn't be missing much if I just threw in the towel and missed out on the last 30 min.&nbsp; I didn't think I'd loose too much sleep over that.   But I'm a stubborn mutha, so I kept at it. (Hey, I'm an Aries)   To make a long story short: Whenever I watch a ridiculous movie,&nbsp;a movie&nbsp;I'm dumber for watching, I usually say, "That was a total waste of 2 hours of my life."&nbsp; With over 10 shutdowns and startups, I ended up wasting around 3 hours of my life watching this piece of crap...   Now, my computer shuts down even more randomly.&nbsp; It doesn't take much now to overload it's constantly dimishing capacity for multitasking or even solotasking.&nbsp; So, I'll be in the middle of writing and e-mail or a blog entry, and poooof, all gone.&nbsp; Try again.   I did some research on the internet, and I got an array of answers.&nbsp; Overheating, bad motherboard, bad RAM, etc, etc.&nbsp; But all of them agreed on one thing: You're screwed.   So... I'm just waiting for The Little One to have it's last day.&nbsp; THEN I'll throw it out the window. hehe.&nbsp;Actually, I'm kinda looking forward to that.   At least I've had the foresight to backup all my files.   Oh, and if anyone's interested, I happen to be selling a Dell Laptop - Great condition.&nbsp; Only $600!!!! Tell your friends. ;)

      Welppp, just saw the new Michael Moore moving picture.&nbsp; I liked it, but I gotta say that my mind hasn't quite wrapped itself around the message yet.&nbsp; And I'm not sure if I really want to.   Ok.&nbsp; Obvious fact:&nbsp; Bush is a boob.&nbsp; We all know that.&nbsp; He's a moron.&nbsp; But Michael Moore had to spend 2 hours re-enforcing that idea.&nbsp; I sided with him on pretty much every issue he covered before I watched the movie, now I have further reason to believe so.&nbsp; It reminded me of when I was in college, studying music.&nbsp; We would take a popular piece of music, and dissect it, finding thematic patterns, and progressions, etc etc.&nbsp; All of these things that made the song such a masterpiece.&nbsp; I loved it though, because it has something to do with something I love&nbsp;- Music.&nbsp; But Michael moore spent the entire movie&nbsp;dissecting the Bush Administration, thematic behavior patterns, etc, and thus proved why the Bush Administration is the UN-masterpiece it is.&nbsp;&nbsp;But I hate politics.&nbsp; I didn't like politics beforehand, and still don't now.&nbsp; It leaves a bad taste in my mouth.&nbsp; Now the taste has gone putrid.&nbsp;   And this is what bothered me the most.&nbsp; I knew that Bush is a wanker (Just like someone could listen to Mozart's Requiem and know it's a masterpiece without know exactly WHY it is a masterpiece), but now I know that it's not only thanks to him, but also his aids, his staff, and numerous other cronies throughout the world. And then something popped in my head:   Could it be just one big awful coincedence that every person under Bush, including the W himself, is an absolute heartless, greedy, tactless, inhuman son-of-a-bitch???   I highly doubt that W. can take credit for being the first president to accomplish that.   In fact, I think the first President NOT to appoint such a wankerish cabinet would have reason to celebrate.&nbsp; But I think we shouldn't hold our breaths.   Governments are a neccesary evil - because if you chose to live in a communal governmentless&nbsp;eutopia, some other asshole country would come along and take you over (especially if your Eden is the size of the USA)&nbsp; We elect the lesser of two evils, every four years.&nbsp; And the guy we elect will probably do the same things that the other would have done, mas o menos.&nbsp;&nbsp;All we can hope for is that he's better&nbsp;at lying about it, like Clinton.&nbsp;&nbsp; At least that would improve our image.&nbsp;   It's not easy living abroad when everyone reacts to me saying "I'm from the US" with "Ugh, I hate Bush."&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm not saying that they all proceed to blame me and the American People for every mistake that baby Bush has made, but it doesn't make it a very positive or fun start to a conversation.&nbsp;   Ugh...&nbsp;&nbsp;Kinda makes me want to buy an island&nbsp;and start my own soveriegn nation.&nbsp; Put up a No Trespassing Sign, buy a German Shepard, and hire armed guards to shoot down anyone wearing a 3-piece suit and a wolfish grin.

        DISLAIMER  - All pictures shown below were taken by me.&nbsp; Except 3 of them, which, and I say this with a heavy heart, I  STOLE  from some random websites... God forgive me...      &nbsp;  Ok... I've put this off long enough...&nbsp; I've been dreading writing the blog entry about this past weekend because I'm positive that it will probably take longer to write the damn thing than it actually took to live through it.&nbsp; So, I've decided not to allow myself to eat dinner until I've written it out......&nbsp;  &nbsp;  So...&nbsp; Here goes nuthin'  &nbsp;  It was good.  &nbsp;  Ok... I'm off to go make me a grilled cheese sandwich.  &nbsp;  Just kidding…  &nbsp;  Ok. As most of you know, any of you that have watched the 10 o'clock news, San Fermin took place in Pamplona this past week -

      Will I live only to become a statistic?  Well, I guess we are all statistics in one way or another.  I guess it's just depends on what you do in your life and the decisions you make that make becoming a certain statistic more probable.  Hmmmm.  I supposed I'll just leave my fate in the hands of that 'ol 'odds-maker' in the sky.  Love you all!!!  MWAH!

      Well, yesterday was the big Gay Pride Parade in Madrid.    All of Madrid's main streets were blocked off around 6:00, and thousands of people swarmed out onto the streets to watch a mile long, 2 hour, rave.  So much for informing the world about the finer organizations related to the gay community.  Actually.  There was one interesting group at the beginning of the parade.  An organization for deaf homosexuals.  Everyone in the group was signing to each other, embracing old friends without a sound.  It was really fascinating.  My sister would have loved it!  And they were followed by an all too short a procession of gay rights activists, toting their plackards and such.  Informing the masses of the inequalities that face the gay community.  Good stuff, but it was hard to pay attention to them when looming behind them was a party bus, blaring techno music, topped with a dancefloor filled with shirtless men in Navy uniforms.  A lovely, and deafening out door, mobile rave.  Cut and Paste that "float" 50 more times, and you have the rest of the Gay Pride Parade.  Buses, Music, Dancefloors, waterfights, and skin.  I wouldn't be uncomfortable in guessing that one watching this parade might think that every gay person in the world listen to bad house music and dressed up funny.     I would have hoped that the gay community would have used this public exposure to enlighten the masses about some of the less eccentric aspects of the gay culture, but it seems that the global concensus there was "I just wanna DANCCCEE!"  Plus, no one in the media wants to film a group of normal looking citezens, that just happen to be gay, marching for equality and encouraging people to embrace their lifestyle.. No way.  They want the drag queen with 2 foot heels, and the half naked leather-types who have extraordinary amounts of body piercings.  Ehh, all in good fun though...  Everyone I talked to today said they had a blast.  Right on...  Ok... On the other hand.. sorry about the infrequency of blogs...  It's too hard to sit here and think of something witty to say when it's this hot.   I think I'm going to go sit infront of the freezer and think about Hotdogs, Hamburgers and Fireworks.  Happy 4th of July everyone!!

      I now fully understand why the Spanish have continued the aged practice of The Siesta.  To the rest of the world, it could appear that the Spanish are a lazy culture who can't bring themselves to work a full day without nap time.    That may be true, I wouldn't dare gauge the work ethic of every Spaniard here.  So, let's assume that most Spaniards have the stamina to work more than 5 hours straight.   Then why the mid-day 3 hour super-coffee break????  But it's too damn hot to do anything else...  Seriously.  You would think that with my snow-white tan, and my ability to burst into flames within seconds of walking into direct sunlight, that I wouldn't be caught dead in any country south of Finland.  But, the my surprise, I actually enjoy all the sunlight.  I think it's healthy.  Sometimes I even choose to walk on the sunny side of the sidewalk just to practice my squint and pray that these 10 minutes ambles might give me some color.  But the heat.. Oh the heat.  No human can be productive in heat like this.  Wether you like the heat or not, you cannot possibly fathom doing anything productive.  It's impossible.  So we just sit in one spot and wait it out.    This can be dangerous of course.  I woke up for my 6:00 class at 6:15 today, thanks to my little siesta.  It's not that I didn't get enough sleep the night before, it's just that it's too damn hard to do anything else!  I think I should start carrying around a pillow, and take my siestas outside the buildings I teach.  At least that way I can just roll off the bench and gross-motor ambulte into the classroom which is only meters away.  Of course, it's not like I'll be of any good use teaching... Because I'm sure my brain would have melted by that point.

       How I Met My Wife    Jack Winter, the New Yorker, July 25, 1994.    It had been a rough day, so when I walked into the party I was very chalant, despite my efforts to appear gruntled and consolate.  I was furling my weildy umbrella for the coat check when I saw her standing alone in a corner. She was a descript person, a woman in a state of total array. Her hair was kempt, her clothing shevelled, and she moved in a gainly way.  I wanted desperately to meet her, but I knew I’d have to make bones about it, since I was travelling cognito. Beknowst to me, the hostess, whom I could see both hide and hair of, was very proper, so it would be skin off my nose if anything bad happened. And even though I had only swerving loyalty to her, my manners couldn’t be peccable. Only toward and heard-of behavior would do.  Fortunately, the embarrassment that my maculate appearance might cause was evitable. There were two ways about it, but the chances that someone as flappable as I would be ept enough to become persona grata or a sung hero were slim. I was, after all, something to sneeze at, someone you could easily hold a candle to, someone who usually aroused bridled passion.  So I decided not to risk it. But then, all at once, for some apparent reason, she looked in my direction and smiled in a way that I could make head or tails of.  I was plussed. It was concerting to see that she was communicado, and it nerved me that she was interested in a pareil like me, sight seen. Normally, I had a domitable spirit, but, being corrigible, I felt capacitated—as if this were something I was great shakes at—and forgot that I had succeeded in situations like this only a told number of times. So, after a terminable delay, I acted with mitigated gall and made my way through the ruly crowd with strong givings. Nevertheless, since this was all new hat to me and I had not time to prepare a promptu speech, I was petuous. Wanting to make only called-for remarks, I started talking about the hors d’oeuvres, trying to abuse her of the notion that I was sipid, and perhaps even bunk a few myths about myselfs.  She responded well, and I was mayed that she considered me a savoury character who was up to some good. She told me who she was. “What a perfect nomer,” I said, advertently. The conversation became more and more choate, and we spoke at length to much avail. But I was defatigable, so I had to leave at a godly hour. I asked if she wanted to come with me. To my delight, she was committal. We left the party together and have been together ever since. I have given her my love, and she has requited it.   (I've gone and made a lesson out of this puppy...  Looks like it's going to take at least 2 classes just to cover not only the meaning of the common negative forms of these words, but the appropriate antonyms... ROCK ON!!!)

      Check out  urlLink FutureMe.org   This has to be one of the coolest site on the internet, if not one of the best forms of therapy out there.  Just go to the website, and write yourself an e-mail to be sent to you a later date (A month, a year, 3 years)  I dunno. The way I see it is, whenever you're having a tough time with life, and all seems to be coming down on you like a ton of tonnes, it's hard to think that there ever could be a tomorrow, let alone a next year.  Writing to your future self helps you think about what's to come further down the line.  Will this break-up that's haunting you still matter as much? What about that fight with your best friend last week?  Will you even remember what the fight was about a year from now?   It's all about perspective sometimes...

      I love it when I have dreams in Spanish...   And the wierd thing is, I can speak it fluently in my sleep.   Huh...  Now if I can only learn how to harness this power, I could concievably teach English during the day, and have people come over at night and sit by my bed while I give them Spanish lessons in my sleep!  Whoooaaa... I would be so rich.  I mean, come on, if you could teach in your sleep, you could charge an arm and a leg so that people would have the priviledge of saying, "I'm a student of the Sleeper Teecher"   God, I need to cut back on all the sugar I put on my Frosted Flakes.

      Someone out there is having the best day of their lives... someone is falling in love, someone is crying because they're so happy, someone is having sex, someone is having a baby, someone is starting their first day on the job, someone is learning how to play an instrument, someone is moving away from home, someone is making a new best friend, someone is having their first kiss...   Someone is doing something they'll always remember...   Someone is reading this blog (I'm sure THAT'S something you'll always remember!)    Are you doing something worth remembering today???        (This moment of inspriational blogging is brought to you by a lack of sleep and a gloriously beautiful day! {or in the words of Zoolander: A really, really, really, ridiculously good looking day})

      ...for figuring out the commenting problem.  (So if you're on one the thousands of people that contact me everyday about how you're unable to post a comment, then here's your solution:   Hi Paul - more interesting insight (ZZZZZZZZZzzzzzzzzzzzzz...........) into the "Comments" - I finally experimented enough to figure out what "allowed" me to finally access and post Comments on your site. What I have to do is, after getting to your Blog, hit the "Reload" button on my Browser. Once I do that, I can comment to my heart's delight - without doing that, when I hit "Comments" - nothing happens. I did this experiment on both IE and on AOL - and it worked in both. So... RELOAD, RELOAD, RELOAD!!! You may want to mention this to others who may be having the same problem.

      Welp, I reinstalled the code for the comment thingies...   So, if you're one of the many (hah) that have been trying to leave comments, but were balked by the system, then, give it a whirl now.  Oh, one more thing... If you were unsuccesful in the past (I'm talking about the comments here), and you have a pop-up window blocker running on your computer, then:  Try changing the settings on the pop-up blocker to allow you to click open new windows  Or, an easier way is to hold down the CTRL button while you click the link that opens the new window.  I think most popup blockers will think you really mean it if you go through all that effort, and it will open up the window for you.  Give it a whirl.
