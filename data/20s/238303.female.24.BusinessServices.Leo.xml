                Tenderheart Bear     You are thinker, organizer, peacekeeper, and leader all in one. You have a power to command attention and people listen to you. However, you are often so concerned about not hurting others' feelings that you don't tell them what they need to hear and this gets you both into trouble. But you always have loyal friends to help you out.           urlLink  Take the  Which Care Bear Are You?  Quiz!

      So Day 2 at Papyrus and I finally get to meet some members of my team.  I only really got to talk to one of the girls today and she was really cool.  It seems like my crew over there really know what they are doing so that takes a lot off of my shoulders.  But to my surprise (sarcasm inserted here), I began to hear a lot of bad things about the old manager who used to work there.  She'd never work, leave and disappear, not train, never do paperwork and run shady under the table deals.  Now I gotta clean all the crap up.  My next two days at work will be dress-down in jeans and just organizing everything in the back room.  The rugrats are still here at the house laughing and giggling all over the place.  It's so cute, when I come home, I hear 2 little voices say "Hi Clarissa!"  and when I leave, I hear two little voices say, "Bye Clarissa!"  Although right now they are being pains in the butts and screaming and running all over my room!

      I just watched  urlLink The Notebook  with Jane.  It's the best real love story I've seen in a long time.  I cried so many times throughout the movie!  I'm such a sap.  It tugged at all of my emotions and made my heart pain for Noah and Allie.     I want someone to love me and take care of me and grow old with me.  I'm so emotional now after seeing that movie!

      What a laid back day.  Got there at 11 and filled out a bunch of paperwork.  Went over the merchandising manual and merchandised a few displays.  Had a free lunch with the district manager and then helped with some more merchandising.  Then I got to leave at 5 pm to go home.  What an easy day!  I did, however, have to hold back the urge to go shopping.  There was so much cute stuff there!  And not only that, I was in a MALL!!!  Sales Sales Sales everywhere!  It also turns out that I have tomorrow off, Friday off, and Sunday off.  It's great!  I still haven't met anyone at Davis yet though.  I really want to meet my team and who I'll be working with.  I think my plan for the first week is to really get to know the people who will be working for me.  I want to get to know them and develop a good working atmosphere.  After work today, I dropped by the Yen King and helped Hwa out for a while.  I got to serve water and bus a few tables.  Not bad... I'm defintely an expert napkin folder though!  Hehehe...  Then Hwa cooked me up some yummy dinner.  Thanks baby.  I promise I'll cook for you soon.

      So the one day I actually get to sleep in a little on a work day, I get woken up at 4:48 am.  4:48 am.  At 4:48 am I hear a little voice next to my ear say, "I have to pee pee..."  It was Karina.  So of course I have to get up and bring her to the bathroom to pee.  At this point everything is blurry because I don't have my glasses on and the brightness of the bathroom light is making me squint.  So as soon as Karina is done peeing and I bring her back to the room, I hear another voice say "I have to pee pee too!"  It was Darika.  So I bring her to the bathroom but at least she knows how to do everything herself.  So she tells me, "I can do it myself."  What a smart girl.  So I get to go back to bed!  I'm so sleepy now.  And it's my first day starting up at Papyrus.  I'll have to post about my first day a little later.  Wish me luck!

      ... are here.  So my little cousins Darika and Karina will be hanging out in my room for this week and another week later.  Fun.  I won't have my own room for a week.  It's gonna be interesting.  At least this time Darika won't be sleeping on my bed.   urlLink Last time  she fell off of it twice!  Hahahaha...  Today at church all the kids were bugging my brother.  Now these two little rugrats get to bug him all week long while I'm at work.  Yay....    urlLink     Also... it's so damn hot in my room!!!  Arrrgh!

      Here's a scenario for you to consider.  So what if you had a brother who was always gambling.  He's so into gambling that he ends up working at one.  So he's working and working but he's also playing and playing at the same time.  It's an addiction.  He plays and plays.  He runs out of money.  He borrows money.  He borrows from you.  He never pays you back.  He borrows from you again.  He tells a sad story, gives a sad excuse.  He still does not pay you back.  He borrows money from shady people under the table.  He keeps playing.  He keeps winning.  He keeps losing.  Soon the losses are becoming greater than the wins and he's still in debt.  The interest from the debt multiplies.  And it keeps multiplying.  He needs to repay the debt.  He keeps gambling to try and win back enough to pay the debt but he keeps losing.  Soon, his life is threatened.  He's desperate.  He can't pay back the debt quick enough.  He owes too much.  He asks you to borrow money again.  He asks you to give him money.  How many times will you let him borrow from you knowing that he will never pay you back?  How could you help your brother or does he have to help himself?

      I feel a little out of it today...  Last night I went out with Lisa for dinner and a movie.  We went to Mel's for Grilled Cheese sanwiches and a milkshake.  Yummy!  Then we went and saw  urlLink The Terminal .  It was a good mix of a storyline with some humorous parts mixed in.  Tom Hanks is really good.  He can make being stuck in a terminal be pretty entertaining.  The only thing jacked up in the movie is Catherine Zeta-Jones.  What a whore.  Hahaha...  She doesn't even end up with Tom Hanks.  She just goes back to having an affair with some Richard Gere look-a-like guy.  Lame.  Although I did like Catherine's hair in the movie....  Maybe I should cut mine again...      What do you think?  So after the movie me and Lisa met up with Hwa and went to Tj's Tavern up in Vacaville.  I got an Appletini that was way too strong so they put more 7-Up in it and then I could drink it.  The 7-Up made it yummy!  Then Hwa orders some Grey Goose Martinis for himself and Lisa, but that crap is strong!  Poor Booty Butt... she didn't know it was straight vodka so she ended up having a Heiny...  hehehe... beer doesn't taste that bad... perhaps I'll just have a beer next time.    urlLink     Me and Hwa at Mel's after I had too much to drink and wanted ice cream!

        urlLink      I've been meaning to post this up for a while now... but I've been lazy.  It's a picture of when that car caught on fire from at work  urlLink a while back .  I called Hwa to tell him all about the excitement and he told me to take this picture.  Now I wish I would've gotten a picture of the car before the firetruck came.  That hella old car was flamin'!

      As M-A-$-E would say...  So I've decied to give Blogger another try... they've changed so much stuff on here and now it's even easier to post pictures.  And the best part is that now they're making it FREE to post pictures!  Although I will miss Xanga's smileys and eprops but I like the newness of it all.  We'll see how this goes.

      I got to meet up and have dinner with my lil bro Stephanie and my friend Keith yesterday.  It was nice to just sit and talk and catch up.  Too bad it was late after work and I couldn't stay out for too long because I had to work early the next day...  So I've just been rearranging and organizing crap at work.  I'm throwing away the old and making room for the new!  It seems like my workers are happy with me.  A few of them have told me that they think I'm a really good manager.  It makes me feel proud!  My old coworkers gave me a call this morning too.  Good ol' Charlie and Danny called to tell me that one of the people I used to work with is going to a different branch in Berkeley.  And also that they are shakin and bakin on an early Friday morning with no cars.  Ah... some things just don't ever change in the world of Enterprise Rent-A-Car.  It makes me appreciate my new job that much more...

      I went out with my co-workers last night to Sophia's for some drinks.&nbsp; Me and Hwa-Shyang felt a little out of place.&nbsp; It's weird how we feel so old now.&nbsp; I had my work clothes on so I felt like I was an old hag since everyone else around me was all skanked up.&nbsp; Damn... should've brought a change of clothes.&nbsp; We only stayed for like an hour... but affter just one drink... I was already tipsy and ready to go!&nbsp; But I did see another familiar face from my past!  My ID picture is still of me when I was 16.&nbsp; So when the bouncer was checking my ID he didn't think it was me and was asking for another form of ID.&nbsp; I've never had this problem before!!!&nbsp; So he asks for this other guy to come over and look at it... it turns out that the other guy was this guy named Justin that I went to high school with!&nbsp; So of course he let me in but still.&nbsp; So strange that I'm running into people now... and in Davis of all places!

      So I guess there might be a rumor going around that my mother passed.&nbsp; Well it's not my mom!!!&nbsp; She's alive and well thank you very much!   This "People from my past"&nbsp; crap is getting kinda nuts!&nbsp; I heard from the ex today too since he thought my mom passed away... kinda weird, but I suppose the thought is nice.   I had a funday with Hwa-Shyang today!&nbsp; It was nice.&nbsp; We didn't really go anywhere though.&nbsp; I woke up early on a day off to go for a long walk with him and his mom.&nbsp; Nice workout although I felt like I was a wimp because I kept falling behind.&nbsp; And since his mom was there, I couldn't really whine or anything like I normally would for fear of her judging me.&nbsp; It's scary!!&nbsp; I just want to keep a good impression of myself!   Then afterwards, we ran some errands and came back to my place to chill with the little cousins.&nbsp; Darika and Karina were so cute and it seems like they are taken to Hwa now.&nbsp; They tell me that he's funny and is afraid of their "scary" face.&nbsp; It's just so adorable to watch him with the little kiddies.&nbsp; They even gave him a hug when we left!&nbsp; They are usually too shy with people that aren't family!   Then we went to eat some Japanese food for lunch!&nbsp; I was seriously craving the sushi after staring at our sushi wrapping paper everyday at work.&nbsp; Very satisfying.&nbsp; Then did a little bit of window shopping and went back to Hwa-Shyang's for a bit of PWC and nap time.&nbsp; So refreshing!&nbsp; All in all a fun day.&nbsp; I even helped to do some bathroom cleaning and laundry folding.&nbsp; I'm such a nice GF!&nbsp; Hahaha... sometimes it's fun being domestic.

      So I saw a girl I used to dislike on Sunday and then today I hear from an old coworker!  I feel like my past is somehow creeping up on me.&nbsp; So I answer the phone today and this girl asks to list the store on her resume because she used to work there a long time ago.&nbsp; She says that her old manager was named Leslie... and that's who hired me to work at Papyrus way back in the day.&nbsp; Then she asks if this is the same Clarissa that she worked with.&nbsp; And of course it was!&nbsp; How weird huh?&nbsp; My old co-worker from WAY back, someone who I thought I would never see again.&nbsp; How small this town of Davis really is...  I also saw my good friend's cousin the other week too.&nbsp; I feel like I'll be seeing quite a few familiar faces working in Davis, whether I want to or not!

      I'm starting to get into the groove of my new job finally.&nbsp; I'm getting used to the different types of personalities and hopefully I'm building strong relationships at the same time.&nbsp; I had my first store meeting today with the girls.&nbsp; I feel like it went well, but I didn't go over everything I had wanted to.&nbsp; We ran out of time!&nbsp; Well maybe I'll be able to go over it next time.&nbsp; I'm such a nice manager.&nbsp; I had prizes, announced a contest, and bought them pizza!   One thing about working there though... it makes me feel like an old woman.&nbsp; I see young people come into the store all the time.&nbsp; I feel like those college days were so far away.&nbsp; I feel like I have so many responsibilities and I haven't accomplished all that I've wanted to do yet.&nbsp; Girls come in at like the age of 22 and 23 to get&nbsp;their wedding invitations&nbsp;and they can afford to buy hella expensive invitations!!!&nbsp; That's where I thought I'd be after college... but it doesn't always happen that way.&nbsp; Economic times are tough and it's just not realistic to rush everything anymore.   What I want to do before I turn 25:   Get my own place or start living on my own.  Have a steady income and a promising career.  Be in a committed relationship.   Sounds easy enough right?&nbsp; I hope so...  Then there's the long-term goals (before 30):   Make hella $$!!  Get married and have kids.  Buy a house.&nbsp; White picket fence and all!   Sigh... I used to think this could all happen before I was 25... but I was so wrong.&nbsp; Let's see if these goals are a little bit more realistic.&nbsp; All I really want is just to follow that American Dream...  OMG today at work, I think I saw this one girl that I used to work with at Cinnabon.&nbsp; I remember I always gave her the cold shoulder because at one time she was dating this guy I really really liked.&nbsp; It was very awkward and I didn't want to admit that I knew her.&nbsp; And I kinda felt looked down upon because, as it appears, I'm just working retail after college and not some bigshot somewhere; when in reality, I'm the freaking store manager!&nbsp; I suppose it's all a pride matter with me but I've always been a proud person.&nbsp; I want to be the best and beat any competition.

      I very rarely ever get road rage but last night, I was forced into it.&nbsp; Here's the story:  So I'm in the fast lane going a little over 70 MPH westbound I-80.&nbsp; It's dark out and I'm trying to pass up a car on my right, but I don't want to go too fast since I'm in a known CHP zone of Fairfield.&nbsp; This stupid White Jeep Wrangler comes along and starts riding my car hella close and high-beaming me. I would usually just stay calm but he was being such an ass about it, so I slowly started to lock him into the fast lane so he couldn't get around me.&nbsp; Then I stepped on my brakes hella quick so he would stop driving so damn close behind me!!!&nbsp; That worked for a little bit until he started to tailgate me again and high beam me so guess what... I stepped on my brakes again.&nbsp; Dumbass still wouldn't learn his lesson.&nbsp; Now this could've went on for hours but my exit was coming up so I had to pass up the car on my right and switch lanes over.&nbsp; What's funny is that when I was switching lanes, the dumb Jeep was tring to switch too so I was still in front of him!&nbsp; Hahaha!  But anyway, so the Jeep eventually passed me up and flipped me off, so I flipped him off.&nbsp; Then I got behind his car and high beamed him until I got off the freeway.&nbsp; What a dumbass.&nbsp; I'm usually not so immature on the road... and I don't condone my behavior at all... but I guess I was just in a cranky mood and that Jeep pissed me off!!!&nbsp; I was about to go C-Murder on him!&nbsp; Hehehe...  The laptop is working nicely so far... I think I've got everything transferred now... or at least everything major.&nbsp; Now I gotta download all the crap I need.&nbsp; It feels nice to have a clean, virgin system.

      I got a new laptop! Yay! Me and Hwa-Shyang went up to Sac yesterday and I bought myself a new laptop... I've been wanting one and I found a really nice one that I like... with a lot of help from my babycakes. Hehehehe...   So which one did I get? I got a Sony Vaio S150. Nice and thin, ultra-portable and nice and simple.       Now I just gotta get used to the keyboard and how to use this laptop... Now I'm so ultra nerdy cool. I've joined the geek club. Hehehe...  I also got to eat at the new Cheescake Factory in Sacramento.&nbsp; The wait was long and it was so crowded!&nbsp; I guess the newness of it hasn't worn off yet.&nbsp; The food was ok, but the cheesecake was YUMMY!&nbsp; I'm such a dessert person.&nbsp; It's funny because Hwa-Shyang doesn't really care for desserts... hmmm... MORE FOR ME!&nbsp; Hahahaha... Hehehehe...

      I went out with Jane and had a belated birthday dinner for her at Chili's and then we watched  urlLink Ron Burgundy .&nbsp; It was an ok movie, got a few laughs out of me.&nbsp; The funniest part was when all the news channel teams came out to have a mob fight and ben stiller busts out being a hispanic news anchor.&nbsp; Hella cracked me up!&nbsp; hahahaha...       Until next time.....   stay classy  !&nbsp; Hehehee....

       I stole these pictures from Lindsey.&nbsp; You can find more pics on her  urlLink Xanga ...&nbsp; although I look so horrible in all the pictures.&nbsp; Pudgey is showing and I have no make up on.... Blah...   urlLink Hal Sparks !      Jamba Juice!

       ... and I made it.   urlLink AIDS WALK 2004 - San Francisco    urlLink     So I started my day waking up at 6 am and going over to SF to walk 10K with my church group,&nbsp;which is roughly a little over 6 miles.&nbsp; People kept telling me that it's kind of like being in a big mall and just doing a lot of shopping but let me tell you... it definitely was not.  We got to the city and was really lucky to find some good parking... then we went over to check-in and find some food.&nbsp; I was really careful about what I chose to put in my belly... I didn't want any problems with digestion during the walk so I just ate a banana and a croissant.&nbsp; No yogurt, thank you very much!  Then during the pre-walk ceremonies, we stretched out with  urlLink Culture Shock .&nbsp; They made us pop our collars and wiggle around a bit.&nbsp; It was pretty funny watching people all try to dance... but then I turned my head and to my horror I saw Channel 7's camera aimed straight toward our group.&nbsp; Damn!!!&nbsp; So if you see me trying to pop my collar on the news, please don't laugh!&nbsp; Hehehehe...  Then after the stretches, they had a lot of people speak to start off everything.&nbsp; I got to see  urlLink Stockard Channing  aka Rizzo from Grease and  urlLink Wilson Cruz  aka the gay guy from My So Called Life and  urlLink Hal Sparks  aka the guy from VH1's I Love the 70s, 80s and 90s specials.&nbsp; There were some other actors and such there too but I didn't really know who they were.  Then there was the walking... it seemed like we were walking forever... and then they told us we had only gone 1 mile... 1 freaking mile!!!&nbsp; I was already so tired and wanted to go back to the car.&nbsp; We were all needing to go pee really bad too but all the port-o-potties were all crowded... so we kept walking... then at Check point 2, it was still really crowded but we had to go pee so we waited for the icky port-o-potties.&nbsp; Still, I kept whining about how my legs hurt...  Then Lindsey and I took pictures with the Jamba Juice Banana and a Transvestite.&nbsp; Hehehe... yes, I did say a transvestite.&nbsp; Then after the we passed the last mile mark, we saw Hal Sparks walking right in front of us!!!&nbsp; That is the closest I've been to any sort of celebrity.&nbsp; I wanted to ask for a picture with him, but I didn't want to seem like some crazy nut so I got Lindsey to take a picture of his profile with her cameraphone without him knowing.&nbsp; It was pretty cool!!!  Then I also got to see my friend Celia volunteering with Aphio, cheering us on!&nbsp; It was cool seeing Aphio still around helping out at these events... I remember back when I used to have to wake up at the butt crack of dawn to prepare the water stations... ah the memories...  All in all, it was a fun day.&nbsp; My legs are sore now and I am tired, but it was all worth it for a good cause.&nbsp; Thank you to those who sponsored me...&nbsp; Your support kept me walking the whole way!&nbsp; Thanks so much.&nbsp; :-)&nbsp; And BTW, it's not too late to donate!&nbsp; You can still donate online  urlLink here .

        urlLink    I went bowling yesterday with Hwa-Shyang, Lisa, and her Reporter buddies.&nbsp; It was unlimited bowling but we went there pretty late so I only got one game out of it and I was  HELLA  tired!&nbsp; But anyway... it's so funny watching Hwa bowl with his swan moves.&nbsp; But he can throw that ball really hard.&nbsp; His secret?&nbsp; It's his Thunder...&nbsp; Hehehe... See it below?   urlLink      Harness that Thunder baby!   And I can bowl pretty well too... I do much better when I'm tired though.&nbsp; I broke 100 last night and broke my thumb nail on the last frame.&nbsp; Damn!&nbsp; But check out Mini Thunder next to Thunder:    urlLink      Hehehe....&nbsp; it was fun times.&nbsp; I even got to eat some ice cream over at Mel's.&nbsp; I've been so good lately, I deserved some ice cream!&nbsp; Besides, my 10K Walk will make up for it tomorrow!

Hwa never gets me flowers so this was a very pleasant surprise.  I was very happy... I love flowers.  Thank you babe.  They're so beautiful and it made me feel so special.  Hwa-Shyang came up for my lunch break and we had some food over at Caffe Italia.  I was hella hungry and I ordered their special... it was so grubbin' good.  It was some kind of Chicken Pomodoro with Angel Hair Pasta or something... And I ate it all!  Overall I had a good day... yummy food, time with my honey buns, and beautiful flowers.  I'll be smiling!

      From Yahoo World Photos:   urlLink      A Thai waiter wears a condom over his head while serving a cocktail as a patron looks on at the Cabbages and Condoms restaurant in Bangkok on July 8, 2004. The restaurant, founded by Mechai Viravaidya, better known as 'Mr Condom', aims to educate the public about safe sex. Bangkok will be the host for the upcoming 15th International AIDS Conference from July 11-16.   Why do Thai people have to be shown in such a crazy light?  And isn't it uncomfortable to be walking around with your head in a condom??  At least it's for a good purpose I guess...  and Thailand isn't  just  about sex, prostitutes and AIDS... it's about food, beaches and cheap shopping too!  Hehehe...

      I saw this commercial on TV today about  urlLink Seasonale .    urlLink     It's a birth control pill that reduces your monthly period to just 4 times a year.   4 freaking times a year!   That is a girl's dream!  I hate getting my period because I always feel fat, bloated and ugly.  Then I get all sensitive and moody too.  I don't have PMS but I all the symptoms come DURING my period.  This Seasonale pill will make life so much more tolerable for all women  and  their men.  The only thing that frightens me is the birth control part of it...  All the risks and blood clotting disclaimers that they put on it...  I do want to have children eventually and I hope that the birth controls wouldn't inhibit any of that for me in the future.  I don't know what the effects are really... I'm pretty uneducated on the topic...  I also watched  urlLink I Love 1992 and 1993  this evening.  It's like a VH1 marathon with me today!  My brother got all happy when they showed his childhood friends, the Power Rangers... They brought up a good point about them too... Why was the Black Ranger African-American and the Yellow Ranger was Asian-American?  I never noticed those subtleties before.  Interesting...  hehehe...  I can't wait until they get to the  urlLink Nsync  years.  It's all about  Tearin' Up My Heart  and  I Want You Back .  Go  Dirty Pop !

      Total Nostalgia.  I watched  urlLink I love 1990 and 1991  this morning on VH1.  I love those shows on VH1.  They totally bring me back to Vanilla Ice, MC Hammer, Color Me Badd and 90210.  It reminds me of how cheesy everything was yet so COOL!  I want a TiVo so bad so I can TiVo all the episodes since I'm never home to watch them.  Sigh...  I also watched two  urlLink Jessica Simpson  specials back to back on VH1.  She's annoying, yet I still like her.  She's just genuinely a good person overall and I think that's the main appeal.  She ain't on crack like how Britney is now and she's so in love with her Nick Lachey.  What a lucky girl.  Too much TV today... I need to get out and do something!!

I'm an attention lover and I ain't afraid to admit it.

      My branch buddy A-Train gave me the link to this  urlLink site .  It's about the realities of Enterprise.  I gotta admit, it's all true, but the customer perspective and the employee perspective is totally different.  I can understand and see both sides, but the most entertaining part of the site is the message boards.  If you are or ever have been a part of ERAC, you gotta check it out.  Also, I tried calling B-Money and Dora on Saturday.  Dora didn't answer and I wonder how she's doing...  B-Money seemed busy at the branch so I didn't get to talk to her much.  I hope they're all doing well.  It seems like A-Train is more in the loop with my old ERAC buddies than I am.  Woo wouldn't even invite me to her shindig!  I don't know why, but I feel left out...

      What's up with guys dieting these days.  I keep hearing guys say how they are on a diet or are watching what they eat.  The only other time I heard about this before was if a wrestler was trying to make weight before a weigh-in.  Pretty soon you'll hear about guys having a problem with bulimia.  Dieting is an ongoing struggle for females, why are guys trying to take it over??  Hehehe...  It's all good.  At least it shows that some guys care about their appearance.  As long as they don't get all metrosexual then it's all good.  I went to  urlLink Christina's  and Milly's birthday party the other night at the  urlLink Glas Kat .  It was pretty fun!  2 drinks and I was already tipsy.  I'm a lightweight and that will never cahnge.  It was cool to see some people that I haven't seen in a while.  I got to see my ex-roomies, Keith and Kalen and a bunch of old  urlLink Aphio  peeps.  After the club, me and Hwa-Shyang went to try and find some Korean food but when we got there, they were closed!  Boohoo!  I was in the mood for Korean food too... but we ended up at the pizza place next door and it turned out to be pretty good!  We even wrote our names in Ketchup on the french fries.  Hehehe...  Then the next night I got to hang out with Keith and Hwa in Vacaville.  We went bowling and I broke 100 both times!  YES!  I did learn something from my bowling class.  I beat Keith once and then I beat Hwa once.  It was pretty fun!  Then today I went to church and found out some pretty shocking information about some family members... it's like a freaking soap opera!  I was shocked... I can't really elaborate on it here... I have to respect my family's privacy, but OMG it's so JUICY!!!  Next Sunday I'll be in the  urlLink AIDS Walk in San Francisco .  Holla at me if you want to sponsor me, or you can sponsor me online  urlLink here .  I hope I'll make it the whole 5 miles!  The more sponsors I get, the more motivated I'll be so gimmee your money!

      Damnit I have a belly.  It's so hard to get rid of.  I've always had some sort of belly, even when I was at my skinniest back in the day.  So pathetic.  Maybe it's because I hate doing sit ups.  It's my least favorite activity along with pull-ups.  To this day I still can't do one single pull-up.  I used to dread the timed sit up and pull-up tests in middle school.  Now I have to make it a point to do some stomach crunches at least once per day.  I WILL get rid of this jelly belly if it kills me.  I'm going to see if I can try to do it without giving up my precious ice cream cravings... I'm not willing to give up ice cream yet.  I went shopping today!  Yay!  It's always so much fun.  There was a fatty sale at Express.  It's nice this time of year becuase every store has a summer sale with big red signs to clear out for the fall stuff that's coming in.  I also got these awesome shoes from Nine West.  They look like a work casual shoe, but it's totally a sneaker on the inside!  Now I don't have to whine about my footsies hurting so much after I get off of work!  And to top it all off, they were on sale!  It's funny the little things that get me all excited.  Have you heard  urlLink Monica 's new song, "You Should've Known Betta"?  It's my "repeat" song of the moment.  This might make me buy her album now.

      I hope everyone had a fun and safe Fourth of July!  I ended up hanging out with Hwa-Shyang the whole day in Vacaville.  I learned how to make some sushi, drank a little bit of Jack and Coke, and watched  urlLink The Bourne Identity .     The movie was ok.  Lots of running around and action.  Not so much of a storyline.  After seeing previews of  urlLink The Bourne Supremacy  and hearing people get excited about the sequel, I felt like maybe I should watch the original and see what's hot about it.  Eh... I might go watch the sequel if someone invites me to go see it but I wouldn't make it a point to watch it.  After a very eventful but weird day, me and my baby went downtown to go see the fireworks.  Now the fireworks in Vacaville were ok, but I had expected them to be better than the ones in Suisun.  Now that only makes sense though right?  Suisun's so much smaller and therefore should have less money funded for fireworks.  But alas... I still think the Suisun fireworks are much better than Vacaville's.  Next year we'll have to go to a metropolitan city to see EXPENSIVE fireworks that are really pretty!  Oh and I watched  urlLink Spiderman 2  last week.  It was a very emotionally tugging movie!  It had a semi-happy ending but it still left you with this very uneasy feeling.  Strange.     At least Mr. Spidey gets lucky in love in this movie! Hehehehe...

      So I had another day off today and I spent it with the kids.   urlLink     See how lovely they look with their scary faces on?  I actually brought them over to see John's new dog, Benzine.  It's really cute and still so small and skinny.  But that thing can climb and jump like a kangaroo!   urlLink     After the doggy adventures, we went to go and have lunch at Hwa-Shyang's restaurant.  My baby's so silly with the kids but they were shy around him.  And Karina, the little one, kept acting up all day!  I think it's crankiness.  Now I need a big break away from them.  I'm supposed to go watch Spiderman later on tonight.  I hope it's good!

      I went back to work today after 2 nice days off.  After a little while at work, I got a sweet phonecall from my old coworkers at the corporate office and they all serenaded me with the Birthday Song.  It was so sweet of them to remember after all this time!  It really made my day!  Then I got a phone call from Darlene!  I hadn't seen her since last Christmas and she was in town.  So after work I got a birthday dinner from her.  It was really good to catch up and stuff and gossip a whole lot.  I feel more loved today when little by little people realize that they forgot my birthday...  I was feeling kinda down in the dumps yesterday because some people forgot.  But I did get lots of love from some really good friends.  Thanks guys... you make me feel special.

      I had a great and wonderful birthday in SF thanks to my baby!  We started off kinda bumpy but it ended up good. I got to eat some VH Noodle since it is a Chinese tradition to eat noodles for longevity. Then off to SF we went...  When we got to SF, we walked around SF Shopping Center, dropped by a few stores and went to the Metreon to see the Sony Store. I was tempted many times to buy some shoes but I held my wallet tight so I wouldn't buy anything. On the way to the Metreon, we went into  urlLink The Container Store . Man that store is so awesome. It brings out the OCD in me. It makes me want to organize everything I have!!!  After all the container excitement, me and Hwa-Shyang took the cable cars to Fisherman's Wharf to go eat some Ghirardelli ice cream! Mmmm, yum yum! I had my Hot Fudge Sundae and even ate some of Hwa's banana split. It was ooooh sooo yummy!      After ice cream, we took the cable car back to Union Square and headed out for some dinner. We ate at this Korean BBQ place and I came out smelling like a piece of meat! It was very yummy though. I just gotta be careful not to eat so much next time. Pudgey was getting mad at me later on in the night...  All in all, a great birthday. Thanks baby for making my day special.

      Well it's official as of midnight today... I'm now 24 years of age. Oh how I've been pushing off this age... been holding on to 23 as long as I could. Oh well... time to get over it and hold on to being 24 for as long as I can before I turn 25! Yikes, so scary!!!  I just finished spending a nice simple day with Hwa-Shyang and we just finished watching  urlLink 50 First Dates . It was such a cute movie! It was funny and it still got me all teary-eyed too!      I think Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore make good movies together! The Wedding Singer was good too! They should do another one.  I also got my first Happy Birthday wish from my baby. It was nice to hear it first from him and to have him there with me. I felt so emotional after the lovey dovey movie moment!

      This morning at work for 4 hours, the corner of E Street and First Street in Davis was completely cautioned taped off to the public because of a bomb scare.  It seemed like all the cops in Davis were there and I heard that even the FBI was there!  The midget cop was blocking off the walkway from the Davis Commons shopping center to E Street so no one could leave or enter.  I felt like I should've been scared... but it just seemed too ridiculous for a threat to happen in such  small town like Davis.  It just appered like all the cops in Davis had nothing better to do so they found a contraption on the ground and made it seem like a bomb.  But then again, I'm still really glad that they played it safe, rather than be sorry if it actually was a bomb.  Scary stuff man...

      I watched  urlLink Along Came Polly  last night with Hwa-Shyang. It was a pretty good movie... Hwa's favorite part was when Ben Stiller ate too much spicy Morroccan food and made lots of squeaky fart noises in the bathroom. I liked the nude french scuba dude's fake french accent. "You scuba?" Hehehe...      Another thing I noticed while watching the movie: Debra Messing's nose is extra big! And they kept showing her profile in the movie too!       See?  It's   HUGE!
