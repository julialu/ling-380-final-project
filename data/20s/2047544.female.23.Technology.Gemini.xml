       Do I dare   Disturb the universe?   In a minute there is time   For decisions and revisions which a minute will reverse.   For I have known them all already, known them all --   Have known the evenings, mornings, afternoons,   I have measured out my life with coffee spoons;   I know the voices dying with a dying fall   Beneath the music from a farther room.   So how should I presume?   We have lingered in the chambers of the sea By sea-girls wreathed with seaweed red and brown  Till human voices wake us, and we drown.
