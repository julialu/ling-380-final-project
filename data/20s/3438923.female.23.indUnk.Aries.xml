      Went to the Caves in Tienmu to pick up some books for the people I'm tutoring. First time to Tienmu - now I know why it's called the "foreign ghetto." It isn't pretty looking, looks like the rest of Taiwan but cleaner and hilly in a sf kind of way. There were a lot of nice stores - and I would of liked to have browsed around except it poured for a while - The most interesting thing about my little trip was the taxi ride to Tienmu from Taipei Main Station.   The driver spoke English really well, too well. When I asked why was he driving a cab (after I found out why he majored in politics at university - after he asked me what I studied in college and after he gave me a mini lecture on the aboriginal people of taiwan, he being one himself---and after he told me that 20 years ago taiwan looked to the philippines as a model asian economy, how ahead it was - and how it has changed with filipinos coming over to taiwan, where before it was the other way around -after he displayed some surprise that BOTH of my parents are filipinos)he told me that he had invested in real estate. Possibly an ex-executive of a development company,  but more like huge private investor of some firm - anyways he lost three million dollars, u.s. -- whoa --- whoa -- because he wasn't like ranting or bitter or whatever, --- and he mentioned that he lost it all when the government changed hands from KMT to DDP? see, i don't know anything about taiwan politics -- he said that the DDP? knew nothing about economics so all of his investments lost more than a third of their value - but he told me he has some investments in vinyl? (plastics...graduate) in Taichung that is providing him and his family 200.000 NT a month, not too shabby - except he's a little worried since he has a son in high school and a daughter at university right now - but he still has an income of around 72.000 u.s. a year...but interesting that he's driving a cab.

      blogs are cheaper than therapists. allright - while i was going to work today, two short blocks down, and three small buildings right - anyways, was waiting from the corner of my apartment building for the walk light to turn green, and across from me was this police car, waiting to cross the street down the street where my apartment is located. my light turns green, so he goes to, except to take a u - turn. while i was waiting those 34 seconds for it to turn green - noticed - while listening to my shakira cd - that the cop was staring right at me - but whatever, as a foreigner living in taiwan - you get used to than - especially if you are ethnically filipino which i am - but more of a cali valley girl if you ask me - anyways i walk, he does his u-turn - which is kinda normal because the driving here is nuts - i'm walking not noticing, and he grabs my shoulder and barks "arc!" my alien resident card. takes a look at it, and turning to the cop next to him, says "meigwo, meigwo" american american. arggg! and more whoa - was way to startled to do anything - wanted to cry - especially since i'm homesick right about now, being six months and 2 days in taiwan.
