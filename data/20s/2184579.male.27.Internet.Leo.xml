      Hey, this must be the coolest tool from a long time, Imagine this On the "Machine 1" you use the digital pen instead on a mouse and when you say copy on a file, the in-built flash memory on the pen will also copy the file (using bluetooth), On "machine 2" use the same pen and browse to proper place and say paste :)    urlLink http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/3774747.stm

      Zindagi aur maut uparwale ke haath mein hai, Jahanpanah. Hum sab rangmanch ki kathputliyan hain jinki dor uparwale ki ungliyon se bandhi hui hai. Kab kaun uthega koi nahin bata sakta. Ha ha ha.  Few others from the same movie:  Kisiko Dekha , Apna sa laga , use choo kar dekh liya , do pal baat kar li.. Bas Babu Moshai  Zindagi badi honi chahiye, lambi nahin  Maut tu ek kavitha hai, Mujhse kavitha ka vaada hai, milegi mujhko Doobti nafson mein jab dard ko neend ane lage Zard sa chehra liye chand uphak thak pahunche Din abh paani mein ho, raat kinare ke karib  Na andhera na ujala ho, na abhi raat na din  Jism jab kathm ho aur rooh ko jab saans aye Mujhse ik kavita ka vaada hai, milegi mujhko  Agli Mulakat yahin hogi.. Itni Jaldi Parda girne nahi dunga  Clip  urlLink

      My dear friend Arvind's favorite poem :)   If you can keep your head when all about you Are losing theirs and blaming it on you, If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you But make allowance for their doubting too, If you can wait and not be tired by waiting, Or being lied about, don't deal in lies, Or being hated, don't give way to hating, And yet don't look too good, nor talk too wise:  If you can dream--and not make dreams your master, If you can think--and not make thoughts your aim; If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster And treat those two impostors just the same; If you can bear to hear the truth you've spoken Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools, Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken, And stoop and build 'em up with worn-out tools:  If you can make one heap of all your winnings And risk it all on one turn of pitch-and-toss, And lose, and start again at your beginnings And never breath a word about your loss; If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew To serve your turn long after they are gone, And so hold on when there is nothing in you Except the Will which says to them: "Hold on!"  If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue, Or walk with kings--nor lose the common touch, If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you; If all men count with you, but none too much, If you can fill the unforgiving minute With sixty seconds' worth of distance run, Yours is the Earth and everything that's in it, And--which is more--you'll be a Man, my son!    --Rudyard Kipling

      Ability is to look at a blank page, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And create a poem. Ability is to stare into the eyes of fear,  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And come out stronger because of it. Ability is to walk into a room of strangers, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And come out with friends. Ability is to admit you are wrong,  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you are wrong. Ability is to get back up,  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you fall down. Ability is to believe,  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When everything seems lost.   Ability - a simple word, with a complex meaning. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For many, ability is never found, but for all ability is within. Ability stares everyone in the face at one time or another. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether your ability is how well you shoot hoops, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How well you flip at dancing, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How smart you are at school. You have ability. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For some, ability is lost by never trying. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether never trying to shoot one more time, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Never trying to bend a little more, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or never trying to score higher in school.  Ability is within. Ability is yours.
