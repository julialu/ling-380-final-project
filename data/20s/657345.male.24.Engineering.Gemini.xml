      Today is the anniversary of one of the most important and nice activities that I had taken part in it:  IMSEE (International Millennium Seminar on Electrical Engineering), 1-3 March 2000.  It was 3 years ago, and yet I can't believe such a long time had passed. Time has really flied, hasn't it?

      I have started this weblog only yesterday, in order to type my English quotes here. It'd be very useful, and I love it to type my stuff in English as well, so that English chaps would be able to benefit too!!!  I'll be adding my Persian posts here and adding links to both sites.

      It's been a long time since last I wrote here. I had the entrance exam of higher education last Wednesday and got my IELTS result the other day. I got 7 from 9 which I didn't expect. I mean I expected it to be higher :)  Till then...

      Finally the summer has started and by Jove, how am I glad now that the exams are done and are a thing of the past. So I don't have to worry about them till next semester, or rather the end of summer. As one of my exams was put off, the happiness is a bit diminished by this unfortunate cause.

      We, my family and I, spent the weekend with one of our friends in their villa located in  Damaavand Road . It was fun and at nights got very cold. They had a dog named  Spike , a good boy. Soon enough we made friends and he started chasing after me here and there, asking me to go and play with him. He was such a large dog, so large that after a bit of playing, during which he used to stand up on his legs and push me backwards, both my arms became painful! But all in all, it was fun and above that I needed it badly.

      It's quite sometime that I've started studying for TOEFL and GRE. The funny thing about TOEFL was that I managed to answer the hardest questions with no special difficulty, but had a bit of a problem with the easy ones. So I opened LONGMAN TOEFL and started studying the skills in which I had problems.
