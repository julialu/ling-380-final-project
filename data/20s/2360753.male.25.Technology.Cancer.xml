      Work was situated between two buildings, a Walgreens and a Safeway supermarket. I was there with a long ex-employee and a new employee (who was kinda a nerd and annoying) and my boss came out of this room, that I had never seen before and was some sort of control room. I have no idea what this means.

      Last night, I drempt that a co-worker, Lea, came to my desk to ask what I was listening to for another co-worker. I have no idea what this dream means at all.

      I was taking a tour of the white house with my mother and grandmother and my aunt and uncle from that side happened to be there as well as Laura Bush.

      The first dream was that my little brother brought over season three of The Shield on DVD, but it was a poor quality rip from a VCR recording.  The second dream is that I was out on the beach with my brother and he went into the water and pulled out a morray eel and attempted to behead it. He only got down to the last string before he stopped and it was still alive and cleaning it's self like a cat. I was pretty disturbed by this so I begged him to finish the job and just put it out of it's misery. I know this one is in connection to the recent beheadings in the middle east.

      My cat, Dolemite, who passed away about a month ago was actually just away and came back. I still had Gunther and they seemed to get along ok. The odd thing was that I had given Dolemite some hot sauce in a playful manner and he had thrown it up on my rug. I don't know what the hot sauce means, but I do know that seeing Dolemite means I still miss him.

      Hi, this blog is an attempt to keep track of my more vivid dreams in order to figure out what the hell is going on in them.

      Dream 1 - I found another black cat who was just like my old cat Dolemite in most ways, the size, the personality and everything and I wasn't sure if it was him or not, but I was going to keep him. He and Gunther seemed to get along. But all of this occured in my grandparent's old house in MA. I still really miss Dolemite.
