       I went on this trip a week before I joined the blogger community, but it was so memorable that I felt the need to mention this somewhere. Besides, I can always refer to the post in case i forgot the route map to kudremukh.    There were 5 of us, Ajay, Anant and myself from my office (ADI), Srik (Srikant from Intel), Sarf ( Sarfarash - Anant's friend ), Manoj (Ajay's friend).    We had BIG plans for kudremukh, which, if had succeeded would have had us 'resting in peace'.       Trekking to kudremukh in the rain - Like in a suicide mission.          Camping at the top of the mountain - Where the chances of lightning  striking you would be a little high (only around 100 %).    Fortunately, the weather cleared on that day, and the forest officials caught us trekking towards the peak in the evening and asked us to go back.    The Trip map - bangalore to Kudremukh and back:       Bangalore to Kalsa -

       Saturday 10th July 2004: ----------------------- Enjoyed an explosive night @ Zero G. We ( my 3 friends and myself) were quite surprised when they let us into the place ( Stag entries on a Saturday night are usually NOT welcome at one of the most happening places in town !! ), but not quite so surprised when they threw us out of the dance floor ( Couples only, they said ). We had already had our share of dance and excitement by then. After 5 hours, we were just too tired to dance.  To top it all, one of us suggested we WALK BACK HOME !!!   Monday 12th july 2004: --------------------- I know I have been infected by the Deadly Dance-floor bacteria. Symptoms : - Laryngitis - Pain in the neck & arse - literally !!! - Swelling of feet ( Though I feel one also gets this problem after walking for   10 kilometers)
