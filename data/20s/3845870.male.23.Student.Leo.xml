      Last night was quite possibly one of the best nights out ever. I can tell this by the fact that I probably won't hear the last of it for quite some time. Who would ever have thought that Ken got to have so much fun?

      A friend of mine posted a link on her webpage. The link takes you a a page where someone has translated the Lord of the Rings : Fellowship of the ring, into Gamerz speak. It is, in two words, FUCKING HILARIOUS. If, that is, you can understand it. I can, thus confirming to any that doubted it my innate geekiness. Her favorite part of the whole thing is the same as mine:&nbsp;     **A group of Uruk Hai encounter Boromir    Boromir: "OH FFS, TEAMS!!"    Uruk Hai [arrow] Boromir    Uruk Hai [arrow] Boromir    Uruk Hai [arrow] Boromir    Uruk Hai [arrow] Boromir    Uruk Hai [arrow] Boromir    Uruk Hai [arrow] Boromir    Uruk Hai [arrow] Boromir    Uruk Hai [arrow] Boromir    Boromir: "****ing campers"&nbsp;    &nbsp;  You can find the whole thing  urlLink here.

      Yesterday, in the United states, a 13 hour stand off involving a gunman and one hostage in a convenience store ended when the Police SWAT team stormed the building. How? Well, there was no back door. So they made one. With a bulldozer. And then a sniper took out the gunman through the hole the bulldozer made. I don't know who was in charge or that SWAT team...But I like 'em!

      All rise and stand for a minutes silence. An era has ended, a legend has died, the dark ages have come to Canberra. Impact records is no more. For those of you who don't know, Impact records was one of those REALLY FUCKING COOL independent record stores, that in addition to selling just about every record ever, also sold DVD's, comics, jewelry, collectibles, magazines and funny as hell / heavy metal t-shirts. The staff were about as alternative as you get, and the whole thing&nbsp;occupied this gigantic basement slap bang in the middle of civic. And now they are turning it into a JB Hi-Fi outlet. BASTARDS!.

      Either the American sense of humour is MASSIVELY different to ours, or the people in charge of the MTV awards need their head examined. The skits in that show were so unfunny it hurt.

      So. King Arthur. There were some very decents parts. And some bits that just plain SUCKED. On a scale as epic as the movie wanted to be, but wasn't. Keira Knightly, however redeems most things in my eyes. I was however, surprised. Isn't usually the guys who come up with the line "tonight we shag for tomorrow we may die*"?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *may have been paraphrased somewhat

      A few posts ago I mentioned the Blog of a friend, someone who is both a better writer and a hell of a lot sexier than me. What I failed to mention was her site actually contains two blogs. The other belongs to my housemate, who now feels distinctly left out. So. Go read her Blog too. She's very cool. They both are. It comes from being a Wench! TM. It's the one on the  urlLink left .

      By the time stamp on this post, it should be fairly obvious that I haven't yet managed to break out of my noctunal habits. Oh well. I only have a 9:30 am exam on Friday.

      Shopping is a lot like sex. It can be a lot of fun, but this aftermath is often a problem. This week however, I am cashed up!!!! So I guess it was good for me then...

      I like being me sometimes. Friend of mine just sent me a message. She works at the local cinema and tonight is her last shift. So she said come on down and I'll give you free tickets. Knowing people is good. Knowing people who are beautiful, nice and wonderful is great. and free stuff is just a bonus. now if only she didn't have a boyfriend....

      Last night my housemates bullied me into staying up all night so they could watch my collection of West Wing DVD's. 9 hours later at...well 9am (we started at midnight) they had seen half of season one. I have a sneaking suspicion a repeat performance will be demanded sometime soon so they can see the rest. And hey, it's not like I mind watching the West Wing. There's a reason I own all the DVD's. But sleep would be nice. And I'm trying to break the habit of sleeping during the day. There aren't enough nocturnal ppl in the world for me to find that worthwhile.

      I have a blog. Excuse me for a moment while I contemplate the coolth of this fact. My own little web page upon which I can let loose the bile and vitriolic rage I have for this godforsaken world. heeeeeem  *takes deep breath* Ok so maybe thats a bit over the top. If anyone was wondering, the reason I finally got off my ass and decided to create this page is that I am procrastinating my University work. Oh and maybe I was inspired by a friend of mine whose level of coolth exceeds mine in so many different ways. She's sexy as all hell too. And she maintains a blog of her own, which is a lot better than mine. You can find her  urlLink here.   She's the one on the right.

      Aaron Sorkin was a creative god. Or maybe cocaine is a creative god, and he was just the medium.

      Good points of the day: Beating the ADFA team at basketball, and getting they're most obnoxious team member in trouble with the ref too. Also: "Go and get naked and wet so I can too!!!"  I love in when females give me orders like that!!!!    (Other notable quotes of the day include "I can never tell the difference between soft and hard")  Bad points:  Once again, I managed to sleep through all of Uni.  D'oh!
