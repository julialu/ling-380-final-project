      Today gather all the ladies for dinner suppose to celebrate stephie's birthday but end up like a gathering. Attendance include Wen, Steph, Grace, Lian, Xiaochui, Waimun and Minghui. A tired monday with lots of work to do, Ron is in reservist so basically now he is like superman. He works 7pm to 7am and continue to camp at 8am but as usual he leave camp a few hours later. His 2weeks reservist will be hell for me because he is using the car and poor me have to go under the hot sun taking cab.

      Today met Ron in the afternoon, he went home to sleep because he worked extra overtime last night from 7pm to 12 Noon. In the evening went Suntec and Raffles City to do my mystery shopping with Wen and Zac. When Zac saw me in the car he asked for my handphone as usual to play Yogibear or Tom and Jerry. Unfortunately I have changed my phone and currently I don't have any games for him. When I told him that he didn't believe and wants to check my phone, so funny this little boy! After shopping send Zac back and met steph and BoyX2 @ Punggol park. Went back quite early around 2am.

      This morning at about 8.15am recieve a call from Steph, must be up to something cheeky. As expected Steph and Wen both on mc AGAIN. However I have arranged to meet my customer and also made a dental appointment in the morning. It have been years since I went to a dental, it feels good after having to remove all that tar from the tooth, feel so clean now. After lunch went to Steph's house...

      Happy Birthday Singapore! Morning was out with Ron to have breakfast @ Hougang,wanted to wait for Zac to be awake and bring him out but Wen was still sleeping till quite late so we decided to go home and rest. In the evening accompany Dad to brother's house and came back to do the stupid Icall Dr (its a system to record and track out daily activities in the field) Hate doing that online thing sucks! There goes my long weekend...

      Today is mum's birthday, having dinner with brother,sister-in-law and Ron @ Long Beach Marina. It was hell of a jam along the expressway because everyone is stopping to catch the fireworks. Not too bad for me dinner with firework display right infront of me although not a bird's eye view but manage to catch a glimpas. After dinner went home,suppose to meet ah lian, shawn and kenneth @ AA but was too troublesome and tired so decided to stay home and watch my VCD. Fell asleep not long after.Ya, almost forgot my dad is back, he have been missing for two months.Got a shock went I reach home,lights were on and brother's room door was closed (Mum was out playing mahjong after dinner). Dad was saying he will be leaving again on thurdays to Hongkong and have been in Hongkong and China for the past few months.Hmm guess he will have alot to settle with the lawyer the next few days in singapore.

      Yuppie! Its a long weekend, haven't had public holidays for the past two months. Met ron in the morning after his work, went to Toa Payoh central for breakfast and walk around to check out prices for my favourite Nokia 7610 (Sleek and nice with that 1 mega pixel built-in camera,woo hoo). Was so tempted to buy when we found out one shop selling for $508, that was the cheapest deal we could find.But guess what ultimately the typical ah beng sales person was trying to sell us a battery with longer standby time and memory card. Not so interested in all that but then Ron was saying he sponsor the accessories so in the end we pay about $600. My heart ache to spend so much on a phone but nevertheless I have not been buying or you should say paying for phone for the past 2-3years (Haha because I sign plan mah, so the phone is free). Okay, I think I shall not dwell on it anymore. Honestly I really adore the phone, function fantastic but not really sure how to use all the functions yet.At night went to crewroom for drinking session with ah kok and co. As usual ron was drunk luckily was staying over at his place so I drove home.

      This morning accompanied Ron to pay the down payment for the loan, followed by car inspection and road tax. Spent a bomb of money today. Hopefully everything is settled and no more sudden hipups otherwise I will brust into mist. Its really tough to have a car in singapore nowadays,let alone our standard of living. Sigh!

      Lian does that sounds familiar to you? for those who don't know,the title comes from a drama that only those who have slag at home for quite some time will know. Basically a long winded drama that started few years ago and still featuring now. For those who are interested tunned to channel 5 @ 1pm mondays to fridays. Today was quite a fruitful day, went to office in the morning to clear my paper work and was out in field at about 11plus. Arrange to meet up with wen, steph and lian for dinner @ nanja monja. Had a good and filling dinner, wen brought a friend a long that looks like my uncle, a little like mickey mouse too. And guess what stephanie chaim told the doctor that did the minor operation for her that she have a friend in the pharmaceutical industry that sells cialis. Best part is this woman is enjoying the anaesthesia and god knows what else she told the doctor. Now i feel damm paisay to go and visit the doctor,all thanks to steph.
