      This has been a pretty normal week for me.  I'm finally getting used to the pattern and the way things work around here.    Every morning, my mommy comes home from work.  We usually go outside and play frisbee for a little while, unless Mean Max the German Shepherd who lives next door is outside.  Then, I have to stay on the leash because I'm not supposed to play with him.  But then, we'll go for a short walk so that I can pee-pee and poopie.  I usually go say hi to my friend Scout, the McCormicks' yellow lab.  He likes to play with me, and he tries to keep up with me, but he's too fat and slow to play very long.  My mommy calls him a "whale" and says that his family doesn't play with him enough.  One morning, there was new dog in our yard, a Jack Russell terrier, so I got to run around with him, too.  He was pretty fast and a lot more agile than me.  We wrestled in the grass when he wasn't hiding under the car!  Then we usually go inside and eat breakfast.  My mommy's pretty tired after working all night, so we take a nap until it gets really hot inside the house.  That's when I wake her up by crawling on her and licking her face.  Later, we get to go outside and have lots of fun.  Sometimes, we go mountainbiking.  Sometimes, it's hiking.  Or we play fetch with the balls and frisbees.  This week, I got to go to two softball games.  I was a very good boy and didn't bark too much during the game.  Sometimes, it's really hard not to though.  On Wednesday, I also got to run around with my friend Basco the Boxer.  He's bigger than me and likes to chew on my neck.  But I just figured out that I can dodge him with quick turns, just like that Jack Russell with me.  We tore all across the outfield after the game was over.  There were other dogs there, too, but I just got to say a quick hi.     Today, we went for a 7-mile mountainbike ride on the Optic Nerve trail in Eagle.  I must be growing because I can run a lot faster now.  I could keep up, even up to 17mph, for short time at least.  Plus, I know when I can get a head start sooner, so I don't get behind.  I like running through all the sage and chasing rabbits on this trail.  The soil was chalky, and when we were done I had white dust all over my face.  I wonder what we'll do tomorrow!  Love, Caesar

      Two nights ago, I got to go camping for the very first time.  It was pretty fun, but it was also very dark with lots of strange noises out there.  And I wasn't allowed to bark very much, even though I just wanted to protect my family and our campsite.  We slept in a tent, which reminded me of my "house" at home, but people slept with me in there, too.  The camp fire was very hot, so I couldn't get too close to it, even though I really wanted to stick my nose in it to see what it was all about.  Then the next day, we went for a 7-mile hike.  I ran around so much that I probably ran at least 10 miles when we were done.  I went swimming in Nolan Lake at lunch and chased pikas and squirrels.  Today I was so tired that all I did was sleep all day.  Love, Caesar

      I know that on my previous website I made some rather disparaging comments about web logs and the people who maintain them and now that I have one, I have reached the height of hypocrisy. Yep. Deal with it.  Maintaining a traditional website was just too cumbersome and inconvenient for me, given the tools available to me and my limited and dated knowledge of HTML, and that's why you saw so few updates to my previous site. So hopefully, with Blogger's much more convenient features, there will be more fresh content for both of you (and hopefully more soon) to read.  From this point forward, please consider me official converted to blogging!  Brenda

If you're an atheist or agnostic or just someone who doesn't think prayer is appropriate in a government setting, you have to suffer silently through infinite numbers of invocations, prayers at football games, etc. etc. etc., but should you deign to ask for "equal time" in what seems a reasonable and appropriate gesture given the circumstances, you are some type of affront to moral decency?  If it's inappropriate for an atheist to give an invocation, then it's inappropriate for ANYONE to give one.  It's too bad this council and others can't see their own hypocrisy.

      Let's see... on Tuesday, I got to go to doggie day care all day.  I was a little scared at first (I usually am), but once I got inside, I had lots of fun and made lots of new doggie friends.  The next day I was still pretty tired, but we did go for a short walk before heading over to the last co-ed game of the season at Ford Park.  My friend Basco and I got to run around before and after the game, and we really tore up the freshly-raked infield before the game.  Yesterday, I was a bit overzealous in chewing on my new bone, and it made me quite sick.  But I was a very good dog and threw up in the corner, behind a door, which my mommy said was the "best place in the whole house to throw up."  I don't like being sick very much; no one does, so we took it easy, and I feel much better now.  I like reading books now.  Well, I don't read them, but I can curl up next to my mommy while she does.    I think my mommy said she doesn't have to go to her icky jobs anymore and that we can play play play for the next two weeks before we do something called "moving."  Love,  Caesar

       urlLink Yahoo! News - N.J. Governor Resigns, Admits Gay Affair : "At a point in every person's life, one has to look deeply into the mirror of one's soul and decide one's unique truth in the world, not as we may want to see it or hope to see it, but as it is."  - Gov. James E. McGreevey  The problem here is that McGreevey should be resigning over the corruption scandals clouding his administration, not because of an extramarital affair, regardless of whether it was gay or straight in nature.  So the whole gay thing - which should not be an issue and and the fact that it is speaks volumes about the state of American tolerance, society, etc. - clouds over the corruption.  BUt you have to give the guy credit for his frank admission and wonder how in the world he campaigned  twice  for governor and served for three years without it coming out until now, unless it was the worst kept secret in NJ.   urlLink Wonkette  has some interesting thoughts on this:  "We hope that someday it won't mean much to go on national television and announce, "I am a gay American." Someday, we hope that kind of announcement comes at the beginning of someone's political career, not the end."  "Sean Hannity, by the way, is having a little conservgasm over this.  "UPDATE: What was I saying? It's a huge conservgasm."  And so was Robert Novak on Crossfire.  Why does this guy have to be so nasty?   More:  "Calm down, my right-thinking friends. This is what I meant yesterday: McGreevey's speech was stunning, inspiring and perhaps even profound. . . It's too bad he's so corrupt.  "One of the reasons McGreevey's speech worked is that while he apologized for what he had done, he didn't apologize for being gay. He made it impossible for anyone to use his sexuality against him and the bluntness with which he did that raises the bar for every public figure who has to cop to a personal crisis on national television. We admire that.  "What would have been really great is if he'd also fessed up to ethical lapses that actually matter. We dream of a world in which McGreevey would have to resign not because he's gay, but because he's at the helm of a political machine driven by cronyism and kickbacks."  And so does the ever-enduring Rep. Barney Frank on coming out:  "I came out at 47, too, though not under threat or anything.  There was a period in my life when I was clinically depressed, on drugs, seeing a psychiatrist - I wasn't functional.  You can be a dysfunctional member of Congress, but not a dysfunctional governor.  In Congress, there are 434 other people. You can't put a governorship on autopilot."

It ranks right up there with those trashy dating TV shows (Blind Date, EX-treme Dating, Elimidate - awful but so fun to watch, you know) or easy paperback reads (like anything by John Grisham or any book you can read cover to cover in 2 days or less) or "Saved by the Bell" re-runs (only the high school years - Zach & Kelly's Prom, Jessie's overdose, etc.) or classic 80s music (Devo, Flock of Seagulls, "Mickey," etc.)  Anyway, it is a Delaware political/gossip blog, authored by still unknown person(s).  It's like the  urlLink Delaware Grapevine  on crack.  All the juicy stuff that everyone knows and talks about - but that we know Celia wouldn't print - is on delatacit.  Of course, a lot of it is just crap, and the anonymous comments are cowardly at best, and mainly incoherent at worst.  Ron Williams likes it, which is also quite specious.  And I am probably not helping matters at all by mentioning it, except for the fact that there are only like 2 people out there actually reading this.      Oh well, everyone should be allowed a few guilty pleasures.  It can't all be the New York Times and Shakespeare all the time.

      Today was a good day.  I'm trying to be a good puppy.  I took a long, leisurely nap all day while my mommy was away at work - well, after I finished my doggy popsicle treat that she had left me in the morning.    Then we went for a mountainbike ride on the "old race course" in Eagle.  Well, I ran.  She rides that thing.  I chased a rabbit and almost caught it.  Then we missed the turn and ended up riding an extra mile and a half.  And I had to run really fast during this section just to keep up.  The last section of the ride was through some very chalky white soil, so I came home hardly even looking like myself.  I had white dust all over my face and legs.  It wouldn't brush out so I got a quick bath.  It was time for a bath anyway.  I have to take one about once a month, right around when I get my heartworm pill.  I think I heard something about day care tomorrow, so I am going to get a good night's rest tonight!  Love, Caesar

Martin Luther Agnew preached Sunday to a packed Episcopal church just down the road from the Bush family's seaside estate. Its oceanfront parking lot was filled with luxury cars made by Jaguar, Mercedes, BMW and Volvo, testament to the wealth of the summer visitors at this southeast Maine resort.  'Gated communities,' Agnew said, 'tend to keep out God's people.' But, he said, 'Our material gifts do not have to be a wall.'  'They can very well be a door. Jesus says, `Sell your possessions and give alms,'' Agnew said. 'I'm convinced that what we keep owns us, and what we give away sets us free.'  Agnew, a guest minister from Louisiana whose summer assignment ended Sunday, swung a golf club to get his message across to the vacationing congregation.  The sermon culminated with a joke about the first President Bush's battle to chip a golf ball out of an anthill. Swinging the club in a mock re-enactment, Agnew said Bush had swung twice and whiffed completely, wiping out hundreds of ants.  The ants got together and agreed: 'If we're going to live, we better get on the ball!'  The former president sat stone-faced through this parable, even as his family, including the current President Bush, looked at him and smiled. "

And we'll spoil the surprise: You can't even see across it. Welcome to Illinois. . . .  'In a move that seems a tad, um, rude, Keyes said he'd get back to them. He's off to Maryland. He'll let them know by Sunday if he accepts their nomination. Whatever he does, the state GOP has created a terrible situation for itself. If Keyes accepts, he will run and will lose. And then he will hop on the next flight back to Maryland, and the state's GOP will be left with nothing but the smell of jet fumes. If Keyes decides not to run, how stupid Republicans will look.

      This website, the  urlLink Current Electoral Vote Predictor 2004 , gives the daily  actual  standings of the presidential race.  While I wouldn't completely trust the results - some states, like Delaware, have no polling data from 2004, and their prediction is based only on the 2000 election - it is a better indicator than the national horserace polls, which are basically meaningless in predicting who will win.  Those polls are only useful for looking generally at trends that might affect the few states whose electoral votes are in play.  If we learned anything from four years ago (although it's something we all knew already), the candidate with the most electoral votes wins.  The popular vote is meaningless, and its the state-by-state battles that matter.

      I had a pretty good weekend.  On Saturday, we drove to Breckenridge in Summit County.  I got to meet Carl Schnee from Delaware and two of his friends, who were in town, for a hike up to Crystal Lake.  On Sunday, we hung out around the house, doing laundry and cleaning up and catching up.  For me, it was a little boring.  Or maybe it's just because I'm a doggie-teenager that I act up.  But my mommy sure seems to be yelling at me a lot and shaking that can whenever I jump or eat out of Cassidy's dish (isn't it my food, too?) or bark or pull ahead on the leash.  I'm sure trying, but it's tough being a puppy and a good one at that.    We went for a good walk on Sunday night in the neighborhood and up to the water tank.  We also got to play some fetch before it got too dark.  I've figured out that those black plastic things sticking up out of the grass are good for a quick and cool drink when I stick my mouth over them.  It stings a little, but it's worth it while we're out on a walk.  Love, Caesar
