      Wow. It's like the old BOA, but slightly more confusing.
     
    


04,June,2004


	 
      don't have scales,  urlLink it turns out . i was as surprised as anyone.
     
    


03,June,2004


	 
      damn you all. i'm still here for an hour yet. but i have read the review, and pronounce it Unforgiving.
     
    


03,June,2004


	 
      I'm going home.
     
    


03,June,2004


	 
      It works for me. Shall I just copy and paste it?
     
    


03,June,2004


	 
      Yeah, OK, it's not working and I can't be arsed to fix it.  It's been a bit temperamental recently.  I'll e-mail a draft of it to you instead dave.
     
    


03,June,2004


	 
      Christ I'm having a stressful day.  I'm pretty much legging it now to get my scarecut before I leap on the train at Broadstairs to bum Dave.  The TDAT review should be working, if not, it's not my fault and I have no inclination to do anything about it.   urlLink So there

      I've done shockingly little work today. I have, in fact, spent a large proportion of it on the interweb.  I also downloaded the 14 day trial of Star Wars: Galaxies last night, all two gig of it. I'm moist with anticipation. I think I may create a wookiee exotic dancer.
     
    


03,June,2004


	 
      i never got to see it. is your site working again yet, uncle fonz?
     
    


03,June,2004


	 
      watch me as i monkey around with your post. tee hee. 
     
    


03,June,2004


	 
      Ahh. I was just trying to find an appropriate size, but you done beat me to it.
     
    


03,June,2004


	 
      that's you, that is.
     
    


03,June,2004


	 
      I broke it. But tee hee anyway.

      Whilst and amongst are archaic versions, apparently. But still equally valid.
     
    


03,June,2004


	 
      this is becoming some kind of necessity here too - this fecher is just a bit too bright and obvious. i'd like to leave this template for posterity if possible and come up with some alternatives for the more sensitive among us, so does anyone know how to take the blogger output and run it through another page? anyone?  christ, customising the boa was hella-easy. i miss that boa. well, in a way.  and what's the difference between among and amongst? anyone? and while and whilst? someone should know.

      I see. The other its. Piss off.  Why do I sometimes see the XML buttons, and sometimes not?
     
    


03,June,2004


	 
      As in 'it is the future'. Or were you talking about something else?
     
    


03,June,2004


	 
      you need a rest, guy. why has no-one complimented me on my nice buttons? or the johnson quote about yoav at the top? why am i always doomed be ignored, and my art overlooked in favour of crude populist hackery?
     
    


03,June,2004


	 
      That's because your reader is Too Straight, like you. You need to loosen up. Hey relax, fella.
     
    


03,June,2004


	 
      my reader doesn't. anywoo, you can just click on one of those XML links over there, and things will look hella different. honest.
     
    


03,June,2004


	 
      Most feed readers will work with Atom, anyway.
     
    


03,June,2004


	 
      blogger uses atom xml, rather than rss. but fear not - i've just converted it to rss with feedburner. take a look at the cheeky XML link on high on the right. there you go. that's not so bad, is it?
     
    


03,June,2004


	 
      It's the future, man.  Fonz, you could get yourself a feed reader (Google for it), and then look at the BOA using it's RSS feed. It'll just look like you have an email program open, or somesuch.
     
    


03,June,2004


	 
      there must be another way to get at the content of the site without all the botting. i'll have a luke.
     
    


03,June,2004


	 
      It's no good, this site is drawing too much attention.  I can't look at this at work, I've already got in trouble once today.  If I don't get something as inconspicuous as PISS back, I'll have to stop using it.
     
    


03,June,2004


	 
      Having misspelled 'Fonz' in an earlier post, I have decided to complete the job. From now on, I shall refer to him as 'Diddy Bot Fonx'.
     
    


03,June,2004


	 
      i am a pulling 66%er. that makes me a little better than ross. which makes sense to me. i am also 30% gay, which is too straight.  i think that these tests are indeed "balls". 
     
    


03,June,2004


	 
      I didn't half panic when that needle went all the way up to 100% gay, til I realised it was just calculating my score.  I am 26% gay, which is apparently &quot;Too Straight&quot;.
     
    


03,June,2004


	 
      Drunk Fonx would get 4% and irreperably stained trousers.
     
    


03,June,2004


	 
      I was brutally honest in the pull-o-meter, and I got 54%. I am a Shy Guy.  Seems about right.  Of course, that was Sober Fonz taking the test.  If Drunk Fonz were taking the test, who knows what score he'd get?
     
    


03,June,2004


	 
      I'm 43% gay, and apparently a 'happy and well adjusted hetero man'. See, it must be true if Channel 4 says it.  I also have a 62% chance of pulling, and it says:  'Always in control, and that often works out the best on a holiday night out, But stop playing it so safe! We know its not cool to get wasted, but you need to let down your hair and live a little! Perhaps a bit of dutch courage will give you that pep you need to go for it a bit more.'  I'm a little confused by that, as I chose to go without food and went for the beers, so would be legless by about half way round.
     
    


03,June,2004


	 
      I took one of those gay tests before, where it reckoned everyone was at least 37% gay on average.  I think I was 1% nmore hetero than average, which surprised me as much as anyone.
     
    


03,June,2004


	 
      See if you are  urlLink good at pulling ...I got 81%. Go here to see how  urlLink gay you are  Fonz anything less than 50% and I know you are lying! I got 29% which is just the right amount of gayness. If the above links come out stupid apologies...I just copied fonz's code and pasted 
     
    


03,June,2004


	 
      If you use the 'post a full message' link, and use the interweb link button to insert the hutchtemel for you, it doesn't add the target=blank shiznit by default. Is there a way to change that, or am I going to have to learn something, and do my linking myself?
     
    


03,June,2004


	 
      makes the target of the link open in a new window. thing is, my work pc usually has about 9 ie windows open at any one point, and takes 30 seconds to open another one. whereas i don't mind hopping forwards and backwards in my "leisure" window. hence my behaviour.  no problem to watch the botter; it's shorter than the other two, and apparently better - i watched the second one the other day, and pronounced it "meh".  you know, like ross would have done. only not as well.
     
    


03,June,2004


	 
      It makes the link open in a new window, standard practice if you are linking to a page on an external site.  i.e. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bbc.co.uk/&quot; target=&quot;blank&quot;&gt;BBC&lt;/a&gt;  I think.  It's not easy typing that in html.
     
    


03,June,2004


	 
      What does that target=_blank thing do? I don't know much hutchtemel.
     
    


03,June,2004


	 
      I demand when you post a link next time dave, that you use a target=&quot;_blank&quot; thing.  Do it.  Now then, to importnat matters.  I think I need to see Larry Botter and The Prisoner of Azerbaijan this weekend, for reviewing purposes.  What are the chances of us catching a showing, maybe you'll see me at the mattinee on Sunday?

      they're considered a delicacy in many cultures, i'll have you know.
     
    


03,June,2004


	 
      I don't think that's a problem you need worry about, Dave.  Unless pots of jizz become a valuable art form.
     
    


03,June,2004


	 
      someone find me a bittorrent/e-donkey/something link to download this for my zboz. it's not out here until august, and i'd never pay for it anyway.  i wonder whether, should i ever produce anything of any artistic merit whatsoever, i'll still be so blase about other people's intellectual property rights?

      I got six out of seven on the BBC news quiz, because I always have to guess at the last question, about the ages of people I don't know.  I actually knew the people today, but misread the question, and put them in order of oldest first. Tits.  Dave, your eye is bloodshot because you burst a blood vessel through overly vigourous wanking.

03,June,2004


	 
      Right, Dave, I'm warning you now, I'm coming to your house later, and I might require food and water.  I'll let you know what time I'm arriving when I'm on the train, but it'll be between 7:30 and 8:15 I should think.

      Yes, I'm not sure why it's doing that. I need to Sort It Out, but I don't seem to have time right now.   I'll fix it at home later.   The film is precisely that bad.  My browser is crashing left right and center.  I can't wait for a new computer.  You know, one that works.

      I've been to 15 of the places mentioned in the  urlLink Ramblin' Man  lyrics. I bet that's more than Ross.  Fonz, your web site isn't working at me.

      It seems to me that we humans are trying to divorce ourselves from the other animals on the planet as much as possible.  We buy our food in supermarkets and cook it, we sleep in well built houses on beds.  We speak to each other and wear clothes.   However, it seems to me that we are still linked to the animal kingdom, because we shit.  It is a distinctly animal trait to just wander off to a corner somewhere, squat and curl one down.  It produces no useful output, it's waste we have to deal with, and it's a waste of our time too, so my question is this:   Do you think a time will come when technology advances enough that humans don't shit anymore?

      Hmm, I tried another e-mail post, it totally didn't work.  Poo.  I'll post it the regular way instead.

02,June,2004


	 
      when i post by email. like this. 
     
    


02,June,2004


	 
      You go to settings, then e-mail.  Then there are two address options.  As dave says, the bottom one has a box in the middle of an e-mail address for you to put a password in.  Then you e-mail to that address, and bob is etc..

      i tried an email post and nothing happened. bah and double-bah.
     
    


02,June,2004


	 
      plus a min four-character .code in it, to stop damo guessing it and posting as them. then all you need to do is send something to that address, and bob's your proverbial.  mine is dave_mf.lovesross@blogger.com. or is it blogspot.com?
     
    


02,June,2004


	 
      El Finz, what address did you send to? I just looked at the settings, and it didn't seem to be set up yet. It also has my name in the address, unfortunately. Sac du ballons!

      I, for the most part, concur.  Especially about the Brocolli thing.  I demand Dave make this page... you know... different.  And move the posting box at the bottom of the page over to the left. I don't like it centered. [If any mofo mentions the spelling of that word, I will have to open up a can of whoop-ass on them]

      The page that is Any idea what time we are due in Epson? I will be nursing a hangover undoubtedly so need to mentally prepare myself for an hour long train trip from Angel. I just ate a load of broccoli...I remember a few years ago I was like "what the fuck is a broccoli?" not believing anything could be so disgusting.  Gradually over time it's become my favourite vegetable. I think we should feature up this page a bit so we can see some distinct advantages over the old one. Maybe an option to upload pictures etc. to the right of the message entry box

      The incredible feeling of excitement I've had all week about the England game tomorrow is slowly starting to be replaced with dread, fear and anxiety.  I hate that.

      I'm only getting about three a day at the moment, but it still annoys me.  Plus, it can't be long before I'm getting a lot more.  SPAM = GAY

      Yeah...spam is a fucker and there is nowt you can do about it really. There is one reasonably effective method which is a plugin for outlook which my old man used for a wile.  (Can't remember what it is called or where I got it from so you'd have to research it a bit!)   It's kind of similar to adaware in a way though.  First it aloows you to specify basic rules (which you can do in outlook already) i.e filter out emails with abnormal characters in the address field/emails with certain attachments etc. The best bit is log file that you download every day from the plugin server which contains a relatively up to date list of spam addresses/domains/subject titles (new ones are created every minute so it doesn't catch everything) He was getting somewhere in the region of 100 spam mails coming from jap domains through to standard "porn" domains...when he slammed this on he got it down to about 10 a day. I spoke to him about this already as I need it but he doesn't have it anymore...anyone tracks this app down or something similar let me know as I also want to break things at the moment.

      outlook 2003 is pretty good at detecting and removing spam, but not 100%. about the only thing you can do is tell it to accept mail only from people in your address book, like on hotmail.
     
    


11,June,2004


	 
      That was not the answer I was looking for.  It seems to me, the smart spammer could send out an html e-mail, and the server would register the e-mail address was valid when the user read the e-mail and the html got served.  Which is pretty much what I expect they do. So as you say, you can't stop the flow of spam.  I thought there might be some sort of blocker I could get.
     
    


11,June,2004


	 
      if you're being spammed, you're effectively bummed. there is no escape. if you click the Remove Me links, you just confirm to them that your email address is active, and they redouble their efforts. the only solution is to close the account and start another.  it annoys the shit out of me because i had a perfectly good email address for 6 years, then some cunts got hold of it through a whois record and now it's 50 spam for every proper email i get. it gives me the rage.

      Yes, I don't think anything will appear until we start scoring.  Either that or we've fucked it.  Why aren't I drinking beer yet?

      Jubus CHRIST, I've been working ALL AFTERNOON on a FRIDAY.  and i had to work late as well.  I need to serously chill out with some whisky and badgers  re Ledley King: 5 Caps comprise one start and 4 second half appearances in Svens 22 man friendlys.  Truth of it is  (22 per team that is.  not 22 on the pitch, cos thats quite standard)
     
    


10,June,2004


	 
      is this working now
     
    


10,June,2004


	 
      Here's what I keep meaning to ask: one of my e-mail accounts has started getting the shit spammed out of it.  What can I do to stop this?

      i had a shave this morning. i resented it as a waste of 5 minutes, but at least i looked less like ross as a result.  the bearded, hairy godzilla scot.
     
    


10,June,2004


	 
      I just went to the bog and looked in the mirror.  It seems my ratty whiskers, over the course of the day, ahve gone from &quot;I really should shave, but i'll just look ratty&quot; to &quot;I definitely should have shaved I look like Gary Neville's best attempt at a 'tache and goatie&quot;.  This embarasses me.

      I think yours is in damo, because you can see Manx pending right?  Attack of the Scones.  It seems we won't appear in a table until we've scored some points.

      is my team in ok fonz?

      is this working now, it stopped working for a while from work as well
     
    


10,June,2004


	 
      I have no idea why manx is still pending in the league.  Let's hope that when we start scoring, it all sorts itself out.
     
    


10,June,2004


	 
      i'm sure glad that damo is several miles away.

I feel like a big poo and because I'm in a nasty mood there aren't going to be any courtesy flushes either...SMELL MY PAIN!

      Regarding posting from home, I can sign in and it recognises me as me but just doesn't have the Book of Arse listed under 'Your Blogs' or whatever it says.  Oddd  Someone try sending me an invitation to my hotmail and i'll see what happens when I try to use that from home

      I had something similar, Dave - someone had jammed a paper clip under one of the control keys on my keyboard, which caused me no end of problems. I had to pry the key off, eventually.
     
    


10,June,2004


	 
      I only see one other team inthat league? Ok I'll get then newer civ game tonight
     
    


10,June,2004


	 
      Manx, I think you still need to submit your team, you appear to be  pending  still.  Ross, you'd better sign up when you get home or I'm going to muck up your lens.
     
    


10,June,2004


	 
      actually, it's not that odd now i look at it again. there just seemed to be far too many letters.  my control key keeps sticking. you would not believe how strangely a computer with a sticky control key behaves. go on, try it.
     
    


10,June,2004


	 
      that's the oddest spelling of "definitely" that i've seen for a while...
     
    


10,June,2004


	 
      That submit button was definateley not there before.  According to my latest battery of tests I'm a peace loving hippy like Dave and my theme tune is Back in Black by AC/DC

      my kev is the III, and is a bit out of date, although i only found that out once i was pretty far into my game. they've release a couple of expansion packs and a raft of patches, so i thought that if i were to have another shot at it, i'd want to get all the newest stuff together first. if you really want the one i'm using, i'll see what i can do, but you'd probably be better off getting hold of a newer version yourself, as that's what i'm intending to do.  i've read a couple of guides to playing on the harder levels of kev, and it's super-hard and mind-blowingly technical. i'm not sure i have the patience to calculate the precise number of turns it will take my worker unit to cross a river, irrigate on square, and mine another and rationalise that against controlling my tax rate so that a new science advance arrives exactly when i need it, while all the time managing my city population's working pattern and growth to alter levels of production to synchronise with an anticipated event in 40 turns' time.  for christ's sake.   urlLink a good bomb or a bad bomb?

      It's like this:  Name: Don't tempt me, Figo Password: iloveross  I also noticed just now that Desailly had made it back into my squad, despite me taking him out ages ago.  I think some of the changes I made originally didn't happen.  Hence Beckham not being in originally.

      i'm not convinced that that submit button was there before. winkers.

      i finished my game of kevinisation last night, most unexpectedly. it was about 1865, and i was launching the second of my glorious wars of righteous liberation deep into the indian hearland, with wave after wave of modern tanks and mechanised infantry pouring into their borders, when all of a sudden a box popped up in the middle of the screen that said "You Win! You have achieved a Cultural Victory" and the game was over.  i felt a little let down, but it at least got me to go to bed before 12.
     
    


10,June,2004


	 
      Ross, build a  urlLink fan foot team  just for shits and giggles.  And you damo, or I'll believe this letter about you being the gayest man e'er to walk the earth.
     
    


10,June,2004


	 
      That is gay.  Listen up homos:  I was just perusing my beautiful Euro 2004 Fantasy Football team when i noticed a little hyperlink at the top that said &quot;Submit&quot;.  It turns out, that although I'd fully built my team, the system doesn't do anything with it until you press the submit button.    I sincerely hope I am the only spaz that didn't notice this, but if I'm not, you guys might want to submit now.

      I doubt they are.  There are a number of reasons you can drop it - Most likely in your case would be firewall configuration or the fact you are a bummer. It shouldn't affect you too much anyhow unless you have some sort of bummer setup...

      Yes, all he will be.  I did the IQ test just now, and got the same score as dave, which i am assuming means we both got them all right:  &quot;Your IQ score is 136   This number is based on a scientific formula that compares how many questions you answered correctly on the Classic IQ Test relative to others.   Your Intellectual Type is Visionary Philosopher. This means you are highly intelligent and have a powerful mix of skills and insight that can be applied in a variety of different ways. Like Plato, your exceptional math and verbal skills make you very adept at explaining things to others — and at anticipating and predicting patterns. And that's just some of what we know about you from your IQ results.&quot;  I think someone should try and beat this score.  You might not be able to post at home because you are not logged in.

      Has Ross finally learned some hutchtemmel?  Dave, can't you just explain to your FM that you're not in a client-facing role, and therefore can dress like a sack of shit if you feel like it?  And also explain why it would be a good idea for him to put his face in a blender.

      That's one sleepy Bambos.  I have a Linksys BEFSR41 v2. All I had to do was upgrade the firmware. Unfortunately, Linksys have designed their site such that it's actually impossible to find anything. Consequently, I was under the mistaken belief that the last upgrade was this time last year (as that's what the site told me), when in reality there had been two since then.  Routers are very interesting.  Also -  urlLink BT finally decides to ditch the shitty old switching phone network .

      what kind of router do you have, and what did you need to do to it?  bambos set up our router, and it works pretty well as far as i know. i think if it had been left to me and yove, one of us would be dead by now, and the other would be sobbing in a corner somewhere. the router would still be in its box, i imagine.  mind you, that's the same bambos that fell asleep on the victoria line at euston and woke up in seven sisters. and it was going south when he got on.   urlLink see where he went wrong

      Ties are gay.  I like being able to come into work in whatever I like, although it makes it harder to distinguish between weekdays and weekends.  I think most of Britney's knee problems could be improved by letting me massage her.  Of course, sometimes the area that is sore isn't the area you need to massage, which I would explain to her as I fondled he boobs and diddled her nubbin.    I've gone over to the bad place.

      i just got told that i have to wear a tie at work again. it really, really annoys me. i'm not sure why, but it does.  i wunt to be a rebellious teenager again. not that i ever was in the first place.

      According to my score predictions, it all goes swimmingly in the group stages.  Then England go out to Spain in the Quarter Finals (on penalties after a 2-2 draw) and Italy go on to win, having narrowly beaten France in the semis.

      there's a little score predictor thing on the bbc sport euro web thing. it's quite interesting, in a way my job totally isn't.

      I've already got my wallchart up and on Saturday I will purchase many beer  Theres no games during the day, This pleases me.  The earliest any of them start is 5pm and thats only really a handful of games.  The rest are all at sensible o'clock

      Too late for you guys but I've just joined a league with mates on this site http://en.fantasy.euro2004.com/  It's got much better scoring with assists, clean sheets, cards, defensive clean sheets, etc. Only missing thing is choosing a manager.  If anyone wants to start on this one let me know as I've started a seperate league we can use when I was mucking about.
     
    


09,June,2004


	 
      I made the change.  Did you notice all three of us have opted for the same manager?  That should ensure some pretty bad luck, right there.  I put up my World Cup Wall Chart the other day.  I know technically it's a Euro 2004 Wall Chart, but that doesn't have the same ring to it.  So I shall be refering to it as my World Cup Wall Chart anyway.

      i don't reckon van horsetelrooy will score very many goals in the tournament.  whoops. i've only gone and said it. i might as well fedex him the golden boot right now.  i'm trying to drink coffee but i'm no good at it.
     
    


09,June,2004


	 
      The way I see it is that Becks is more likely to score than Gerrard full stop. (Frank Lampost is more likely to score than Stevie G) Becks is also less likely to get broken/sent off in a rage of red-misted headwrong  I've decided than I'll keep my team as it is, downgrading my Wesley to a Latvian or a Stelios would only allow to upgrade my Torres to a Morientes/Trezu-Gay and not all the way up to a Ruud/Thierry.  Thats not a good enough trade off

      i had a ross-inspired dream once. it ended with jets firing rockets past skyscrapers into this enormous pair of legs that was terrorising tokyo.  i finally found  urlLink yoav's purpose .  i stopped playing kevinisation at half ten last night, and managed to get to bed on time. and then i had a phone call at about 12.45. it was a cheerful greek, who said "i fell asleep on the tube and i'm stuck in seven sisters. i can't get back to balham. can i come and stay at yours?". i said yes.  then there was another call a minute later: "do you know any taxi numbers? there's only one driver here and he's a mentalist who doesn't know where camden is". i gave him the only taxi number i know.  then another call: "the taxi number's no good, there's no-one this side of london. none of the bus drivers knows which bus i need. help!". i gave him the number for the transport helpline.  at 2.45am, i had a bambos on my doorstep.  this morning, i mostly want to die.

      The way I see it is that Gerrard's more likely to score from open play, and is the braver choice, but Beckham takes all our penalties and free kicks, and with Mickey on the pitch we're bound to get a penalty or two...  I'm erring on the side of swapping Gerrard for Becks.  I haven't seen your formation manx, but you do need midfielders who are going to score.  They also get an extra point for scoring over a striker.  So the decision is yours really.  Have you signed up to the league?  I had a dream that Dolly's house kept getting burgled last night.  It got burgled once, and she was too afraid to stay there, so she left the house and stayed at someone else's.  So the burglars broke back into it again.  The next day the same thing happened, but this time she left her keys in the door, and the burglars took EVERYTHING.  I suppose it was a Ross-inspired dream on some level.

      Billius Ballius was very funny...his pwartishead take off was bwilliant I have to say but lost on 90% of the audience.  There was some idiot in front of us who clearly didn't get half the jokes...he tended to laugh about 3 or 4 seconds after everyone else started.

      I'm glad you like it.  It will be even better when Dave turns his designer's eye to it and improves it.  That film 7 thing is a bit of a fuck up.  It's not supposed to do that.  Hmm.

So, can someone go to  http://www.topfivefilms.com/sampledb.jsp?filmid=  that address, and put any number from 0 to 6 on the end, and it should work.  I'm reluctant to put a proper link on here because it seems to shaft my site for some reason.

      No, of course you didn't get up before me Dave. You missed by about half an hour.  I predict that you will enjoy Bill Bailey. It is oolarious. He does a very credible impression of Portishead, too.  I've already typed this message once, only to be unceremoniously logged out from Blogger, and have my message lost. I hate Websense more than Jesus.    And he hates it a lot.

      Why is there an advert for gays up at the top of this page?  I bet this is really why Ross wanted to move to a blog.

      The overnet connection isn't of much use unless you are sharing over 20 odd gigs...overnet is a series of hubs which have minimum shares.  Anything of worth is usually only found on servers over 20 gigs...hence if you aren't sharing enough...the hub won't feed you anything. Overnet is pretty pants anyway...I used it a year ago or so for a couple of months...fastish connection speeds but you always get cut off by the people you download from if you ever get going too fast.  Not a problem for small files but for films and isos etc. it's a real pain.

      For the record, eDonkey2000 came first, and connects to Overnet and another ed2k server.  eMule came second, and seems to run better and look nicer, but it only connects to one ed2k server and not overnet.  Og course, they both have updates released regularly, so neither of them are older and therefore worse.  I'm not sure which is better, though.  Is it lunch time yet?
     
    


15,June,2004


	 
      I wouldn't say that Greece knoebbed Portugal.  Portugal just played really badly and Greece gave them a good Germaning.    Mind you, they could well do the same to England  
     
    


15,June,2004


	 
      If you did, wouldn't you know which one came most recently and which was better? I put it to the honourable gentleman that he knows as little as Dave or I...either way, they both smell of poo and wee and stuff. I am phoning Aiden now to tell him to turn up at Hammersmith now...not now...at 7.30...you know what I mean...if you don't...it will be ok...I promise
     
    


15,June,2004


	 
      Having listened to your collective eDonkey/eMule ramblings, I've come to the conclusion that I am the most knowledgable on the subject.  I'm still not sure who I WANT England to face if we get to the Quarter Finals.  My inkling is Greece, but then they gave us a run for our money a few years back and dicked Portugal the other day, didn't they?  I don't really want to come up against Spain, even though they bottle it a lot.  Maybe Portugal is a handy middle road...
     
    


15,June,2004


	 
      So now we meet in Hammersmith rather than 'somewhere central'  Thats fine by me to be honest

      You made me leave the pub with half a jug of beer still left - A sacrilige that you will be made to answer for sometime soon! Emule/Edonkey...one came before the other the latter being based on the prior.  Find out which came first and you will have your answer...
     
    


15,June,2004


	 
      did i get up before you today, ross? i demand answers!  i'm super-glad that i have tomorrow off. i think i almost passed out twice earlier, presumably from fatigue. although i did drink half a beer last night, so that could be it.
     
    


15,June,2004


	 
      i've used emule, and found it prettier. i've no idea how performance compares, though.  we face the winner of group a (is it? the one with greece, spain, russia and portugal), assuming we come second in the group. so it looks like spain at the moment, although if greece beat them, it may well be bambos' buddies.  i'm finishing work at half five tonight, going home, getting changed, pouring some kind of food into my mouth, then heading for hammersmith about 6.45, i imagine. should arrive a little before half seven, in time to pull aiden out of whichever establishment of ill-repute he's accidentally wandered into, pick up the tickets, resuscitate damo (with those little heart-paddles that george clooney uses) and take our seats in time to hear that the show's cancelled because it's too hot or something.  that's my plan.

      You know...M-Games have probably been summoned to the courts in America as a result of Yoav's failure to answer any phone calls from Wireless Developer/Airbourne but unfortunately the letter has been lost in a pile of papers on Wobu's floor.  You may think I'm joking...I'm not.    Living in ignorance is not intelligent...and yet it is those who think themselves intelligent who are most ignorant.    I just made that up...nice.

      I think thats a promise that Joe just can't make, or at least keep.  To get to Hammersmith my research tells me you go to Hammersmith tube (which was as big a shock to me as i'm sure it is to you)  This lies on the Hammersmith & City, Piccadilly, and District lines.  I expect the Apollo should be pretty clearly signposted from the tube.  So, whats the plan
     
    


15,June,2004


	 
      I moved over form the eDonkey to the eMule last night.  I am undecided about the change so far. eMule doesn't connect to the Overnet server, does it?  So who do we want England to face in the quarter finals if they ever get that far?  I demand answers.

      david james = lexie when it comes to football. a massive case of the retardation.  our tickets will be waiting for us at the box office tonight. they sent them out in may. i bet woab's swallowed them accidentally. does anyone know how to get to the hammersmith apollo? we'll need to get there for 7.30 or so, i imagine. someone ask aiden.  i'll be going to brum for the cricket day, as long as joe promises not to try to put his finger up my bottom when i'm asleep.
     
    


15,June,2004


	 
      Yeah, I've seen a clip of that on TV.  I have no idea what James thought he was doing standing in the middle of the goal there. Becks, as it turned out, knew best.
     
    


15,June,2004


	 
      Dave, check  urlLink this link  out   Half way down on the right is a picture of Beckham in the wall pointing to the right - The fateful moment I mentioned last night where he shouted at Cole to get back on the line and every time Beckham turned his back, stupid David James sent him back to the wall...need to find a movie of it now.

      there is a shower. but only one, and it turns out that people use it all the time. i'm not sure i should be nipping off for a shower after 9.30, but seeing as i arrived in plenty of time before work and was denied my opportunity, i don't see that i have any choice. it's either shower now or smell bad until lunchtime.  no sign of the tickets, but i have a nagging feeling that the envelope containing them is sitting under a stack of papers on yoav's desk somewhere... like that old insurance letter that they still talk about in hushed tones at the back of pubs. i'm calling the customer service line as soon as it opens - at half ten.
     
    


15,June,2004


	 
      Is this a shower at work?  Christ, you have it easy.  I wish I got paid to have a shower and go to the gym.  Anyway, here's the real question:  IF England don't fuck up and manage to get to the quarter finals, which team from Group A do we want to come up against?  I need to decide so I know who to support this evening.
     
    


15,June,2004


	 
      portugal are going to get knocked out tonight. we shall see, say i.  the shower is still in use. i've been here since five past nine, and there's been some MOTHER-FUCKER in the shower every time i've tried it. it's enough to make me very angry indeed. and even smellierer.
     
    


15,June,2004


	 
      and i mostly stank of beer. i'm going for a shower now.
     
    


15,June,2004


	 
      Yeah, that was my favourite bit too. Gotta love that compski.
     
    


15,June,2004


	 
      I done finally looked at that 16k thing.  for n=0 to 2   Those were the days next n  Now that's some funny compsci shit right there.

       We were losing the game 1-0. She was on there a long time and nobody seemed to want to do anything about it. In the end it was a case of get over there and push her off the pitch...     ...the stewards and police were letting her get on with it and they seemed to be quite happy to stand there and look at her. I'm going to send her a letter to say thank you because she fired me up a lot and a few minutes later I scored our equalising goal!   Gillingham manager Andy Hessenthaler thanks a streaker for her part in the Gills' win over Wimbledon.   Yes, that's the kind of manager we have.

      I just carefully negotiated my right to leave early on Thursday so I can get home in time for England's match, and them I remembered I'm sharing a car with my mum this week, and she'll probably have to work til 5:30.  Dude, that is so fucking weak.
     
    


14,June,2004


	 
      i just found a muddy little stain on the front of my shirt, and i've no idea how long it's been there. i bet people have been staring at it all day, and thinking to themselves that i must enjoy dripping poo on myself in the morning.  i bet that's exactly what they've been thinking. either that, or "look at the spistock who can't drink coffee properly". my money is on the former.

      I have no idea what a mighty boosh is, and I am not impressed with your efforts to sell it to me.  I would at least expect a short description, the channel it is on and the time it airs.  Also, too.
     
    


14,June,2004


	 
      i also think so too.

      Also, I think I also put too many 'also's' and 'too's' in that last post, too.

      It is indeed Helen's birthday today. You must be some sort of memory man. Let's all have a rousing chorus of that song... you know, the one to wish someone a happy birthday... what's it called again?  I hope some of you bummers have been watching The Mighty Boosh. It's veddy funny. Also, I Am Not An Animal is good, too. Although it's now finished, so I guess it was good.

      I don't understand this at all. I just checked my site, it was all working beautifully.  I pasted a link on to this page, and when I clicked on it, my site had stopped working.  It's not working now either.  What the fuck is that about?
     
    


14,June,2004


	 
      how's it going, wee man? any luck with the insurance claiming?  stop that working nonsense. people will just expect it of you in future.  is it helen's birthday today? if so, happy birthday helen. if not, happy birthday ross.

      i see bobby pires has very kindly decided not to rub his arsenal colleagues' faces in that consummate french victory. he's a generous chap, isn't he?  i appear to be short of a wee pseudoscotsman this morning. and to think i went to the trouble of making that link for him. where be he?

      Any transfers you make should be in the Czechs I reckon...German/Holland will not be high scoring, nor is it safe to predict either will keep a clean sheet. It's kind of hard to keep track of what points you should have though because of managers/cards/goals/clean sheets...even if there is something slightly wrong with the calculation - we all "suffer" from it.

      last night that i went on graham norton's show, and spent the whole time telling him what a big gay bummer he was, to the delight of the audience and much to his amusement. it all seemed fine and funny at the time, but in retrospect i must have come across a terrible homophobe.  see what i did there?  hur hur gayers.

      Blimey did the French lose last night?  That's a turn up for the books.  I'm having a few days off from football to get over the terrible, crushing disappointment.  I wish I didn't wake up at 7:50 am every day, regardless of when I need to be up.

      Au revoir Froggies  I'm in a kind of unique situation in that I really don't dislike any of the teams still left in this tournament ans wouldn't mind it if any of them won.  I can't remember that ever happening before

      I hadn't heard that.  I have now.  I've run out of things to do now really.  Can I be arsed to hang around for another half an hour?  There is only me and some weird, low-paid, religious nut who breathes to loudly and talks too quietly left here.  I think I'll go. I want to complete Splinter Cell.

      It's always a good idea.  I've been needlessly productive today.  In fact, I'd say I've done a whole week's worth of work in my few hours here today.  But there's nothing else to do...  It seems wrong, yet it sounds so right.  I have one more job to do, but I can't charge for it if I do it today because I've already charged out my six hours of time.  So I might leave it for m'colleague to do on Monday, and spend the next hour an a half filling out a job application form instead.

      Well, I don't think I'm supposed to talk about it, but it probably can't do any harm.  However, I think I'll wait until I've been released for good (next week) before I spill my guts.

      Yes, I enjoyed seeing Cole piss rings round the spotty little wanker.  Also, Neville played well the whole tournament.  Gary, not Phil, obviously.

      Yeah, the dutch are going out in the next match anyway, so my support for them will be short lived.  Besides, I've noticed while watching them that they are very entertaining - every so often they let what appears to be a horse on to the pitch and they just let it gallop at the goal.  From six yards out.  The context banner at the top seems to be about football now.  Oh yeah, dave, I've noticed that when I load this page and scroll down, it suddenly jumps back to your anchor tag at the top.  So I have to scroll down again. I thought perhaps I had a #top on the end of my bookmark, but I don't.  So it must be your fault that this happens.  Make it stop doing that to me.
     
    


24,June,2004


	 
      my first reaction was to go with the dutch, as i've done in every competition since 1998 after we've gone out ("dennish bergkamp! dennish bergkamp! DENNISH BERGKAMP!" etc), but then i remembered that the world's only other diving horse plays for them, and i don't want him to win anything.  so now i'm an honourary czech. go praha. go pavel.

      I couldn't post a message so have sent him an email instead...told him it was 12 against 11 last night and that I had awarded him the Man of the Match award - I have never seen a player influence a match so much.

      I'm siding with the dutch and the Czechs, just as soon as I've assassinated a certain Swiss referee.
     
    


24,June,2004


	 
      That was a negative, and what i need is 2 positives.  Oh well, at least all that 'eng-er-lund are gonna win' bollocks is finished.  All we need is Henman to go out of Wimbledon as soon as hunmaly possible and we can have a relaxed fucking summer.  The weight of my support is now behind the Czechs

      I've gone all English tonight, no portu-gays. Call me Jingoistic if you will.  I've got a few frogs, dutch and a swede too.

      i'm sticking firmly with sweden tonight.  i can't afford any decent players anyway.
     
    


23,June,2004


	 
      Indeed.  I have put a guy away.  I have to go back on Monday and do it all again though.  And I have to go to work tomorrow I think.  Also, Malaga is in Spain, not Greece, although I suspect damo will protest that he already knew that, but not offer an explanation of his Greece - Malaga comment.  Call me Nostradamus.  I need to tinker with my team for tonight's match... do I put my eggs in the England basket, or do I "bet against" them to ensure a result either way. Hmmm.

      i did it this morning, and that was fine. i might now skip the gym and knock off back to camden and change before the match. that way, i could eat some Original Home Cooking. which is to say, microwave nasty.  i need a bambos now. my guts are all wrong.

      a wank i think.  where is ross? oh that's right, glastonbury. and fonz is putting someone away for bum-rape. oh, the irony.  i have work to do and am bored. is the rest of the country like this? is this why the japs are doing better? ARE the japs doing better?  ...  bored bored bored bored bored.  this must be how bambos feels all the time.

      Yeah, the last one was good fun...I've decided I might get wasted...I've invested heavily in the English as a sign of support.  Personally I think the French are where the points are at for the quarterfinals though...the Greeks are going to get hammered right in that place they enjoy so much...Malaga!

      I thought you had a bit of a shit day pointswise yesterday Dave.  I had four Dutchmen, including Van Nistelrooydonk.  I was bit gutted about the Czech second string, i was pretty sure Nedved would be rested but I expected Cech to play at least.   I actually like the look of my team now and am going to restrict my tinkering, i wouldn't mind a Portugeasy player or two but would that be disloyal?  I might transfer out Reizeger for an englishman maybe.
     
    


23,June,2004


	 
      i can't believe that i forgot to tinker with my team yesterday. not a single dutchman. i'll never recover. 
     
    


23,June,2004


	 
      i'm still disappointed that they played their second XI last night. i missed out on all the points i should have got.  right... portugese defenders for tonight's match, then?
     
    


23,June,2004

      That's weird, it looks better now.  It's an intermittent problem.  Also, I don't think the Ag monster is in that film, but one of the two main characters is 30.
     
    


22,June,2004


	 
      I see.  Two more things:  This page is broken.  The bit on the right is all wrong in my browser here.  Secondly, does anyone know when Andy And Jenny's anniversary is?
     
    


22,June,2004


	 
      although someone tole me that the aguilera monster was in it, and she's about 33. the main one is 17, as far as i know. which is legal in some states. anyway, you should never use that phrase, as what you need to say is:  "...while definitely a girl film, there's plenty of eye candy from which the boys can form ejaculatory teenage fuck fantasies..."  i have a new plan for the weekend. ed's driving up on saturday morning from epsom, so i'm going to high-tail it down there pronto on saturday and join him in the capri-of-love all the way up the m40. assuming we go down the m40. as such, i won't be going up on friday anymore. in case that wasn't clear.  i'm hungry.
     
    


22,June,2004


	 
      I'm writing a review of Mean Girls.  Do you think I'm allowed to say the following:  "...while definitely a girl film, there's plenty of eye candy for boys to feast their eyes on too..."  Or does that just reveal to the world what a pervert I am? I think the girls in it play 15 year olds, but the actresses that play them are about 18 I think.  I'm wrong, aren't I?

      Ronaldo, Luis Figo and Wayne Rooney are standing before God at the throne of Heaven. God looks at them and says; "before granting you a place at my side, I must first ask you what you believe in." Addressing Ronaldo first he asks, "what do you believe?" Ronaldo looks God in the eye and states passionately, "I believe Football to be the food of life. Nothing else brings such unbridled joy to so many people from the slums of Rio to the bright lights of Madrid. I have devoted my life to bring such joy to people who stood on the terraces supporting their club." God looks up and offers Ronaldo the seat to his left. He then turns to Luis Figo , "and you, Luis , what do you believe?" Figo stands tall and proud, "I believe courage, honour and passion are the fundamentals to life and I've spent my whole playing career providing a living embodiment of these traits." God, moved by the passion of the speech offers Figo the seat to his right. Finally, he turns to Wayne Rooney , "and you, Wayne , what do you believe?"   "I believe" says Rooney "you're sitting in my seat."

      i see that the italians are claiming that the scandy result was a fix. well they would, wouldn't they?
     
    


22,June,2004


	 
      I'd probably change Ibrahimovich for Larsson and possibly Zambrotta for, wait for it....Ashley Cole. I hate Ronaldo - He is a one trick wonder to me but he throws defences into disarray which is pretty damn useful so I would leave him in.
     
    


22,June,2004


	 
      tomasson might be worth a shout up front, but only because of end result, rather than thkillth and that. and gravesen is a gee boo.  i'd say that to his face.  i too had a message from aj, and it only upset me a little. but then he really does love too much, doesn't he?  that ross: hippie.  send me the pit crew thing.  i am damp.
     
    


22,June,2004


	 
      I'd have Van Der Saar (?) in goal and I'd leave out Ronaldo, he's a one trick pony.  Overall, I'm pretty glad the Italians are out.  They are the Peter Ebdon of European football - they grind you down.
     
    


22,June,2004


	 
      Ok, I know the group stages aren't even finished so this is premature but this is my team of the tournament so far.  GK: Sorensen LB: Zambrotta RB: Neville CB: Campbell CB: Carvalho LM: Nedved RM: Ronaldo CM: Zidane CM: Gravesen F: Ibrahimovich F: Rooney  Discuss

      I'm going to Glastonbury.
     
    


22,June,2004


	 
      I actually felt really sorry for the Italians at that moment.  Then i remembered how they've bored me shitless during the rest of the tournament and began taking glee.  I've seen that photo of Rooney, its quite good.  Has anyone seen the mocked up sky sports article about ferrari hiring some new pit crew, thats also quite funny.  Did anyone else receive a slightly disturbing, slightly Damo-esque message from Mr Sinnott after the England game
     
    


21,June,2004


	 
      eeeexcellent. good old the scandies.  did anyone else take perverse glee from the look on cassano's face when he scored and 6 seconds later?  i'm damaged, aren't i?

      No.
     
    


21,June,2004


	 
      To explain the drivel in last post...photo of rooney halfway through his celebration flip...trail of hub caps, wallets, etc. falling out of his shirt. Haven't seen photo of ZZ Bald Top's chunder...kind of glad I haven't as well!
     
    


21,June,2004


	 
      Has anyone seen the footage of Zidane chucking up before he scored the penalty against us?  Shame the French bastard didn;t slip over in it like that guy in Gran Canaria.
     
    


21,June,2004


	 
      I wouldn't Ross...he just wants to make a masturbate over you. Anyone seen the photo of Rooney doing halfway through his flip celebration from the Switzerland match with a continuous flow of wallets and hub caps falling out of his shirt? It's tres amusing

      i demand that you post a picture of yourself with no hair.  a picture of your head, that is.

      i thought i might have been labouring the point a little. anyway, fonz is the one with the dodgy blood system - clearly not enough blood to go around there.

      i'm going to catch you, damo. and when i do, i'm going to hold you down.  i have no definite plans at all for the weekend, aside from finish work at some point and get on a train. then call joe when i get to new street.  maybe i should think about it a bit more.
     
    


21,June,2004


	 
      so, as far as this weekend goes.  has anyone got any firm plans yet?  has anyone actually spoken to Joey and found out what, if anything might be happening on the friday night.
     
    


21,June,2004


	 
      I shot ahead on the fantasy again...only a few furlongs to go now!

      i dun did yoga again this morning. i feel curiously warm now. i wonder whether the two are related.  does anyone know any english wingers?
     
    


21,June,2004


	 
      In answer to your question fonz, it happened the minute David James became England keeper.    Trot forward 3 steps, he's coming to get it.  back 3 steps, oh no he isn't.  oops they've scored

20,June,2004


	 
      wow, that Rooney'll be a good player once he's grown into his face  But dammit, When is Garth Crooks going to confirm we've qualified
     
    


20,June,2004


	 
      Shit! He must have a foot like a traction engine!

      I just listened to His 'n' Hers. I'd forgotten what a spanking good album it is.  Also, I've had all my hair cut off, and now I'm cold.  Message ends.

      To clarify...it isn't the website introducing the ban on smacking children - there won't be bbc police running around banning people from the website with shouts of "You were smacking your child whilst viewing our website!"...no it's the government.  Stupid government
     
    


20,June,2004


	 
      Just read an article on the bbc news website that is talking about introducing a ban on smacking children.  All fine and well...what happens when you have a deaf, dumb and blind kid raping women left right and centre...how do you let him know he's done something wrong - the beats of course.   I think they need to work a few clauses into this bill...clearly not a enough thought has gone into it
     
    


20,June,2004


	 
      That game is appalling. What were you thinking, Dave?
     
    


20,June,2004


	 
      That is the worst game I've played in a long long time.  If I'd made that, I'd be ashamed to put my name to it.
     
    


20,June,2004


	 
       urlLink this  is rubbish, and reminds me of a beavis and butthead minigame from 1997 which was much better. and it's in italian.
     
    


20,June,2004


	 
      damn you fonz, my gun was jumped. i'm mostly looking forward to you trying not to discuss the trial before it's concluded, and making one small but significant mistake which leads to death by burglary.
     
    


20,June,2004


	 
      or something
     
    


20,June,2004


	 
      I'm shitting bricks about tonight, and I am not confident at all.  It's a potential death trap. Mine field.  Whatever the expression is.  I've been juryorying.  It's incredibly dull.  I might tell you all about when it's all over.
     
    


20,June,2004


	 
      If we look at recent facts though. 1/You were filled with impending doom for France - Proven correct. 2/Switzerland you were confident we would win - Proven correct  Result - Confidence tonight = Victory for England  Reasons why the above is balls statistically...endless  
     
    


20,June,2004


	 
      you're right, ross, but unfortunately i find it really, really funny. bambos is to blame, honest.  he  is .  i'm feeling confident for the first time this tournament, which is a very bad sign indeed.
     
    


20,June,2004


	 
      i'm feeling extremely unconfident for tonight

      Yeah, I've already got almost the entire portugal squad in mine, so only a fool would do the same now.  I am cursed.  And, like most people, I have no desire to see Macy Gray in the nude.  Mmmm, nude.
     
    


02,July,2004


	 
      I'm gonna get as many Portugeezers in my team as possible and then greece are going to fuck me. i just know it
     
    


02,July,2004


	 
      So Macy Gray is to perform naked for charity then? I can't help thinking she would raise more money asking people to pay her to keep her clothes on...there's just no need Macy

      i've fed mine the feedburner rss, then all i need to do is leave the mouse pointer over each post for a couple of seconds to get the full effort. it's not perfect, though - although you can jam it full of rss feeds from all over the place and it keeps you informed. sort of. the bbc ones are good. it also saves me looking out of the window by telling me what the weather is like outside.  i went shopping. i got:  empire magazine (although i had to buy a second copy cos mysteriously the pages got stuck together on the first one, right about page 100) black dahlia dave gorman's googlewhack adventure love all the people (bill hicks) last tango in aberystwyth (read the first one - briwwiant)  it was 3 for 2 on, um, 3 of them. now i want to sit down and read them all immediately.

      I was wondering that.  Ok I'ver got this sidebar thing going on,and I'm on board with the idea.  But the best I can make it do is display the first few words of each message on the BOA, and if I click on it, it loads up the full boa in IE.  That's no good.  Tell me how to configure it Dave.

      it's my bloody curse again. mind you, portugal have nothing to worry about:  in their quarter final, the referee was swiss; their opponents had knocked out switzerland in the group stage, and his performance was highly questionable.  in their semi final, the referee was swedish; their opponents had knocked out sweden in the previous round, and his performance was highly questionable.  now all we need is a czech referee for the final, and we're all set. although he's german. but he probably hates the greeks anyway.  seriously, it IS a conspiracy.  i've not done any packing, and that was my one aim this evening.   i  can't do anything.

      hmmmm, I had a few too many Dutchies and not enough Portugays in my team tonight I reckon.  Still at least I had Ronaldo.

I quite enjoyed it, really.  But it's not as good as the Geisha book.  Speaking of holidays, my mum has been saying I should have one, and she's now got to the stage where she's going to go in some travel agents and try and find one for me, so I'll get back to people about it when she comes up with the goods.  Obviously, I'm too lazy to investigate the situation myself. I thought at one point I wasn't. I was wrong.

      Just to clarify, I meant you should read 'Join Me' by Danny Wallace, not just that you should join me in reading the Black Dahlia.  although you should actually do that too

      might as well. any others? has ross read any books while growing his leg hair?

      jamie "fat-tongue" oliver was telling me the virtues of sainsbury's sausages just last night. i didn't believe him, though.  i hope banksy enjoyed his fry-up leftovers.

      Tesco have a good selection of sausages I've discovered.  I had some traditional pork and herb ones cooked by Gibbos fair hand on sunday and some pork and chilli ones last night.  I also have some Pork and stilton in the freezer.  They're on offer at the moment  Great

      I watched that Boosh thing once.  I didn't think it was very funny.  I have seen Monkey Dust, and I thought it was quite good.

      I've done that before, by leaving a posting window open for a few minutes, it uses the time the page was loaded, not the time you pressed "Submit".  I remember now, Scarlet is playing the woman.  I should have mentioned that earlier.  There have been quite a few interesting stories about the Dahlia on the BBC film site over the past 6 months or so.  I'm supposed to be writing a review of Shrek 2 (bless you) but all I really want to do is play FFX-2.

      Scarlett Johansson is to play the woman aparently, thats a choice i actually agree with

      Its just such bad casting, both those cops are supposed to be double-hard ruthless bastard ex boxer types, I also think wahlberg and hartnett are too young.  I'd cast Michael Chiklis, in both roles

      I am a font of Knowledge, dahlia wise.  Lessee: I've read it, and enjoyed it.  It's about a woman who gets murdered in LA in the 50s, and two cops have to investigate.  And they both fall in love with a girl who looks a bit like the girl who was murdered.  She is nicknamed the Black Dahlia, and it's pronounced DAY-LEE-AAHH.  Hartnett and Wahlberg do play the two cops, Fire and Ice or whatever their names are. Their names both begin with B I think.  Anyway, it's been in the pipeline for quite a while now, and will doubtless be cack.  No LA Confidential, that's fo' sho'.

      ross, with this on-line geekery, you are spoiling us.  i'm tempted, which shames me. but it would cut down my wanking hours, which is a problem. i'd have to miss work for 30 days to compensate.  i wonder whether anyone would notice?

      maybe marky mark will play a bumbling, affable corpse in this one.  i've never read the black dahlia, and have no idea what it is about nor how to pronounce it correctly. hell, this probably isn't even the right spelling.  what's wrong with the neoboa today?

      It wasn't me...I was in the pub with my mates - drinking to Ross's Last Stand.  That's what they've named the mud puddle that Ross passed away in at Glastonbury.  Some sweet fella from the Gnome Brigade has even left a little doll dressed in a tartan skirt next to the now dried up spot that claimed wee Ross Mctaggart.  When the wind blows the skirt lifts gently to reveal a couple of shrivelled walnuts...they knew him well.

      You may also want to ensure there is a nearby hospital - This will allow you to sit on your 6 foot spike safe in the knowledge that you are only a stone's throw away from getting NHS treatment for the recurring internal haemorraging and gangrene outbreaks you suffer at the hands of your preferred domicile.

      is it a pain in the bum because you're moving onto a 6-foot rusty iron spike?  remember, ross: location, location, location. ensure that your rusty iron spike is close to local schools, shops and amenities, and has a view of the canal.

      after getting back to the flat in time for the second half of the czech game, i thought i'd best get to bed early or i'd be as sick as a dog this morning. so i went to bed after fantasy football, and read for a bit, then turned off the light, lay back, and immediately felt incredibly sick.  spent several hours going to and from the bathroom feeling like i was going to throw up, then not throwing up.  i AM bitter today. i could have spent that time playing pes with a bucket in my lap, if i'd known.

      That would be the one...I find it pretty amusing that almost all the (I refrained putting a made up statistic in there in favour of a sweeping statement) Sugababe photos you see are of the two fit ones.

      I couldn't agree more.  When you pinch a girl's bum they should smile and possibly give you a flash of their undies, and when you pounce on them and try to snog them, they should not only let you, but be extremely grateful for the attention afterwards.

      Fonz's message came back. What the fug is up with Blogger?  Damo, you were doing so well - but it would also be 'fewer people in jail'...  I must take up Dave's crusade while he is away. Where did he go, anyway?

      Interweb is important it has to be said.   Saturday night was good fun...me, 3 other guys, 15 or so fit women.  In a club being molested by 4 women at once was awesome. Which brings me around to an important point.  When I'm in a club and grab random women, a slap can be expected or perhaps a firm kick in the junks.  Women need to be more open to the occasional grab and squeeze/forced kiss/love making...that way there would be fewer rapes and less people in jail.
     
    


04,July,2004


	 
      I seem to have killed Fonz's message.

      We get the keys to our new house tomorrow evening. One of the first things I'll be doing is phoning up Telewest to say 'make proper telly come on my telly, and make porn come on my interweb.'  Yes.

      Oh yeah, you done moved house, didn't you?  Let's all laugh at Ross and his cack TV and lack of innernet.  Where the heck is everyone today?  And when I say everyone, I mean Manx.  I went to the pub at lunch time and it was great.  There's a new bar maid there who is the fittest bird I have clapped eyes on for a very long time.  I'm going again tomorrow lunch time, at which point I will be asking for a detailed copy of her work roster.  If she often works there between the hours of 11-6, I'm going to have to find a different job I think, so I have more time to camp at her door step.  I think "camp" was the wrong choice of word there. Perhaps not.

      why no tv and no interweb McRoss? I lost interweb for a bit yesterday...

      No really, it does. I only have five TV channels. It's like living in the stone age.

      I'd quite like to see him direct though.  I only hope they can convince Vin Diesel or The Rock to take the part of Superman - it'd be one hell of a film...  Lois Lane - Whoopi Goldberg?

       The Man of Steel is also grabbing headlines today after the Superman logo appeared on www.michaelbay.com, which claims to be the "official" website of the golden-haired helmer. It sparked a wave of rumours that Bay might be about to replace Charlie's Angels director McG in the hot seat of the long-awaited Superman remake.   The Superman people try desperately to sign up the worst director in Hollywood.

      christ, knightley's looking uncannily like portman these days. or what portman ought to, had she not let herself go a bit. anyone seen the photos from the king arthur premiere?  another pot here, nurse.

      nope. he said the guys he was working for were "pretty small time". or something like it. i think he was going for trump before.

      Did he get that internship he wanted?  You know, for that guy I'd vaguely heard of, but didn't know who he was? You know, the one that made Wobav cream himself when he spoke of him?

      he should keep a diary of his internship in noo yawk. "today, i made coffee, did some photocopying, and gave seven blow jobs. i love my job. dah." i'm telling you, it's all true.

      Eeeexcellent. My boss is out all day, and the only person who sits behind me has just left early, meaning no-one can see me surfing the interweb all afternoon.  To be specifimic, Fonz, I now live on Warwards Lane, which is the other side of Raddlebarn from Hubert and Tiverton and that.  I work almost in Aston, the other side of Aston University, about 15 mins from the city centre. It is a shitty area. If this were SimCity, it would definitely be light industrial, with quite a lot of black buildings.

      I found it interesting, and then being the sensationalist I am, I have told everyone that they've found life on Mars!  When asked to expand I told them they'd found a little man.  He was just like a man, but his eyes were in the back of his head. And he was little.  I don't think people are believing me.  Ross, where do you live and work now?  And what does Helen do now?

      i have to stay off the messenger or the bogtrolls get me. that is:  our isa-server and firewall block many ports and protocols, and messenger is among them. however, the managing director and the chairman want to do things like use messenger and listen to hebrew radio, so there has to be a small ip range that sits outside the protected band for them to occupy.  i'm not supposed to be on that range... but... i am. so i can use messenger, but if i'm spotted, then it'll be immediately obvious that i'm not going through the firewall, and that my web access is unrestricte and i'm running kazaa all the time.  that would be a negative. having said that, it's lunch time at the moment, so you never know your luck.
     
    


14,July,2004


	 
      Yes, if only they'd taught us something useful, like how to spell the word practical.

      Dave why are you never on messenger these days?  That Onion article got many cynical chuckles from me. I think we should send it to all our compski lecturers. I cant think of a single practicle thing they ever taught us.

      It happens to us all occasionally.  I've used and configured Apache/Tomcat, IIS and Resin, and I have to say IIS comes out as the worst of the three in my opinion.  It's arguably easier to configure than Tomcat, and definitely easier than Resin, but other than that it sucks ass. It's not very powerful and, like ASP, I find it a bit clumsy.  I like to Be In Control.  Plus IIS probably isn't very secure.  That Onion article from 1969 is pretty funny this week.

      Right I see we need a proper compski here and I'm the properest I know.  Step 1: Stop using Outlook and ie cause there insecure and generally shit. Use Mozilla Firefox(browser) and Thunderbird(mail client) especially Firefox cause it has tabbed browsing, blockes all popup adverts and wont let spyware on to your machine via activex. Thunderbird doesn't auto open virus ridden attachments either. There both basically great.  Part the second: Compski as I am I still cant love linux. You'll spend a week finding the text files you need to edit to make things work then another week figuring out how to edit them. Everythings painful and even though you think your learning things youll forget it instantly and besides what youve learnt wont work on another distro which brings me to the next thing about Linux. Choose your distro wisely. I reconmend SuSE cause it has some graphical tools for configuring things. But overall you may well be better off with winxp and and windows apache client.  As for web servers Apache and Tomcat are ok but you still have the annoying impenetrable text file based config files.  Ive never used IIS I suspect its insecure but easy to config.  Dave with Yoav you should get him on one of those reality shows where they dump someone in a jungle and get them to fend for themselves. When he cant use his psychic link to Zodiacs Wobu slaves to sort out the festering snake bite on his leg he will either learn really quickly how to organize his own life or you wont have a problem with him any more! I bet we can forge a will signing his flat over to you.

      What's the point of all this anyway?  Ross doesn't know any HTML.  You can't make a website like that.
     
    


14,July,2004


	 
      hosting .NET is free as long as you have a windows server 2003 licence. which most people don't.  then there's PHP.
     
    


14,July,2004


	 
      You can use Outlook to connect to hotmail.
     
    


14,July,2004


	 
      Yeah, this free stuff is all well and good, but it's mainly geard towards the use of Java and JSP.  So if that's what you're after, then go for it.  If you're only after regular HTML, then anything's good for that.  Otherwise, you could get some .NET action going on, but that's probably far from free.  I mean, hosting .NET is free I think (?), but the tools for developing it aren't.  Then there's PHP.
     
    


14,July,2004


	 
      resin be free for personal use and small companies, but not if you're the size of zodiac. that's why we had to switch to tomcat. that and the fact that resin can't handle struts.  turns out that wobu's insurance has also expired, and he has no vehicle registration documentation. the mind boggles...
     
    


14,July,2004


	 
      Right, I'll shower tou with my opinions and gloss over the facts:  I use Outlook for my regular mail, and I think it's more secure than Outlook Express.  However, you can't use it to connect to hotmail, so I use outlook express to connect to one of my hotmail accounts. I have no idea if it's secure or not.  As for servers, I have no preference for operating system.  Linux is supposed to be good and free, and is probably worth trying out at least.  Is this going to be a server for serving up web pages and the like then?  Have you any idea what sort of site you want and what technology you're going to use?  If you're after free stuff, I guess Tomcat and Apache are the way to go, but in my opinion, Resin is still a better server.  Not sure if it's free or not for personal use.  That's not much help, is it?

      1: murunno. outlook's prolly better. 2: murunno. prolly. everyone lubs linux. and apache's fine. we use tomcat here, which appears to work.  i am the crown prince of noncomittal compsc.

      nope, i didn't pay for it - the company did. apparently his dad will settle up when he's back from his latest business trip. but the thing that gets me is:  wobu will never know.  when he gets back in september, he might just notice that one of his tyres has changed shape or that wheel is no longer yellow, but i doubt he'll think anything of it. cos, you know, stuff like that is always happening.

      I have some right proper compsci questions, the answers to which I can't be arsed to find myself. So do my thinking for me.  Question the first: Is Outlook Express still riddled with security problems, or is it okay to use now? I remember Microsoft recommended you didn't use it to connect to Hotmail, but that was years ago now.  Question the second: I've realised that I have enough old computer parts to build another machine, so I was thinking of putting together an interweb server. I remember people talking about Linux and Apache. Is that still the best (free) way?

      Right, I don;t know if this'll work, the site is gaying me up a treat today.  Do I understand then Dave, that you paid for the work on Yoav's car?  Why?  Why would you do that?  Why can't the Mecha-Zinch stump up?  Also, I suck pretty bad at that golf game, but not as badly as Ross. I do pronounce it balls though. If that were a real golf course, I don't think anyone would ever get round it.  Not without golf balls that float and a decent boat anyway. That game is nowhere near as good as  urlLink this one .

      Wow, I suck super hard at that golf game. I gave up before finishing the round. I didn't see the point as I was already 30 over par.
     
    


14,July,2004


	 
      Sooner or later, Yoav will kill himself.  For most people this would be a comment in jest...in this case I 100% believe it.

      shaddap youse - you're older than me. well, you look like you are. it's the hairy godzilla face, you see.  i'm accidentally a bit hungover today. i should probably go to angel this evening and shout in damo's ear for a couple of hours. that'll help.   a story about woab's car once upon a time, woab went to new york, leaving his car in the garage of our building. his dad came up to me at work on monday and asked me to bring in the car keys and the widget to open the garage doors so that they could take his car to get a service in his absence. fair enough, i suppose - i brought the keys in on tuesday.  yesterday morning, the bloke who's sort of the official driver for the office came over to my desk and asked me for the address and instructions of how to get there etc., as he'd been told to spend his working day getting yove's car sorted out. fair enough, i muttered, and gave him directions.  he came and found me again at about 4 yesterday afternoon. it turns out that he'd taken the yovemobile to the garage, and there they had discovered a few things:    he'd been driving around on a flat tyre, and had destroyed it, meaning a new tyre   he'd also been driving around with the emergency tyre on another wheel, left over from the puncture before last, for probably a month   his rear brake pads were 95% worn through   one of the rear wheel bearings was cracked and buggered - the entire hub had to be replaced   his MOT was two months out of date   he'd had no road tax for over a month    the total bill for the work done, including road tax and vat, was £880-odd.  fair enough, i hissed through gritted teeth. someone has to take care of these things...

      How can you not see the adverts THEY'RE RIGHT THERE.  the golf is on the BBC sport site, you should be able to find it quite easily.  I'll attempt to improve on my score later, i'm sure i can shave two or three strokes off

      I have no adverts.  I'd like to see The Cooler, but I can't seem to interest anyone else in going. William H. Macy looks like Dave did five years ago.  Ho ho ho. Dave - he's very old.

      I'm not quite sure how it has happened, but I don't see the adverts anymore, not at home or at work.  They must get blocked by some sort of ant-virus thing maybe...  What's the address of this golf game that you so badly want me to beat you at then Manx?  Or am I going to have to look for it myself like some kind of chump?  I watched The Cooler last night.  It was pretty good.  It reminded me of all the other Vegas movies I've seen, like Swingers and Very Bad Things, but most of all it reminded me of Leaving Las Vegas.  All spam is shit and for gays.

      now i think about it, to see what damo has to say about his favourite pornography. and ross, for that matter; i imagine that he can get all the thrills he wants just by lifting his kilt and peering downwards any time he likes, so it may be an interesting answer.
     
    


13,July,2004

      It's a warehouse, where they house wares. The top floor has been converted to offices, but when they did that they made the wise move of bricking up all the windows and covering all the skylights.

      I saw a telly programme a few weeks ago called 'Train Cops', or something, following Transit Police about their business. It went between stations all over the country, and showed some amusing national sterotypes.  In Lahndahn - some blokes are having a scrap on the platform, and when the Train Cops turn up, some woman goes mental and has to be arrested.  In Brum - some thieving scally nicks a woman's suitcase while pretending to help her carry it.  And, of course, in Glasgow - a skaghead is caught shooting up in the station toilets.

      yes, it is SQL. i have a grid of results 21 columns wide, and each column has its own query, as they all pull slightly differently filtered data from the same tables, with slightly different joins. the rows are generally, but not always, the same, is it's to do with attendance and processing figures from the zodiac remote offices - one count query per office per column, and some offices don't show up in every single one.  aaaanyway, i need to combine the individual queries into a single one, while keeping the data produced separated with different column headings. i'm thinking that i'll union each resultset with the next, keeping the SQL distinct, but in order to union two queries they have to have the same column headings, which means that i'll have to fabricate column headers on each query for all but the column that is being populated.  of course, just to make things interesting, the queries are being built out of little modular blocks of my own creation, as (because of the different ranks involved) each query is effectively run 3 times, with one line different in the Where clause but everything else the same. so the whole thing needs to generate in a loop.  here's an example of one of the queries - not too complicated:  /*GET NEW APPLICANT OFFICERS*/ select i.description, count(*) new_applicant_officers  from persons p, identifiers i, persons_history ph  where p.persons_rank in ('CPT','C/O','2/O','3/O','C/E','1/E','2/E','3/E','EE1','EE2','EE3') 	  and p.source_code in ('BUL','BOT','OZR','EST','ODS','TPI','LAT','BEO','CNT','DIA','ESP','BEG','TGL','DON') 	  and p.source_code = i.code 	  and i.identifier = 'SOURC' 	  and p.persons_code = ph.persons_code 	  and ph.status_code = 0 	  and to_char(ph.timestamp, 'YYYYMM') = ? group by p.source_code, i.description  and i need to combine it with the next one, which looks like this:  /*GET NEW JOINER OFFICERS*/ select i.description, count(*) new_joiner_officers  from persons_voyages pv, persons p, identifiers i  where p.persons_code = pv.persons_code 	  and pv.sign_off_date is null 	  and pv.joining_rank in ('CPT','C/O','2/O','3/O','C/E','1/E','2/E','3/E','EE1','EE2','EE3') 	  and p.source_code in ('BUL','BOT','OZR','EST','ODS','TPI','LAT','BEO','CNT','DIA','ESP','BEG','TGL','DON') 	  and p.source_code = i.code 	  and i.identifier = 'SOURC'   	  and to_char(pv.joining_date, 'YYYYMM') = ? 	  and not exists  	  	  (select * from persons_voyages pv2  		  where pv2.sign_off_date is not null  		  		and pv2.persons_code = p.persons_code)  group by p.source_code, i.description  and then five more like it. note how some of the tables are the same, making a standard join impossible without table aliasing, and i'd have to do it at least seven, and possibly 21 times. it's also worth noting that these two queries are in fact six, because each will be run three times (with different rank codes in the persons_rank collection).  so, wee man, help me.

      When I am the law, I reckon I'll make everything you all do or own illegal, and then get rich by turning you all in.  It's nothing personal, mind.

      The sort you have is.  I tried that download, and it all seemed to be going swimmingly, right up to the point where we rebooted the machine and the password change hadn't worked at all.  We ran the nt_pass tool on it and changed the admin password and the user password, and saved all the changes.  And nothing seemed to have changed at all.  Hmmm.  I wish I could read the FAQ for that utility, but it's blocked from here.

      Hmm, it appears I've suddenly borken the law then.  So what's to stop people ruling that other stuff I have is now illegal to own? Seems like you could get stitched up pretty badly by this "law" stuff.

      i remembered what i'd written - i was horrified and self-loathing at the time, but couldn't be arsed to change it.  not sure why the links have moved, but i'm pretty sure that it's damo's fault.

      Anyone seen this  urlLink Star Ocean  game? I'm looking forward to it as much as playing Kingdom Hearts. Man, chipped PS2's are the best thing since normal PS2's. Everyone should get one.

Anyway, I'll have to go again tomorrow until I get my weekly fix of ridiculously fit bird.  Am I supposed to be coming up to London on Friday then?  If that's the case, I might have to come back on Saturday so I can sort some shit out on Sunday.

      Killing Charlie is a fundemental part of any American child's education.&nbsp; The first time&nbsp;an American&nbsp;child wakes up screaming "They're in the trees...they're in the fucking trees" it's cause for celebration within the family.&nbsp; It's kind of like the Barmitzvah (if that's how it's spelt) in Judaism,&nbsp;the Coming of age celebrations in Hinduism/Sikhism or your first car bomb in Islam. &nbsp; They celebrate with hot dogs and bud beers...it's true (see what I did there)...MTV told me.

      Hmm, I don't think that's correct Fonz.    urlLink This  is a&nbsp;list of all the companies in the world making more than $100bn of revenues in a year. The top is Wal-Mart who make $266bn, which is around 140 billion quid. So I don't see anyone incurring as much cost as you have there.   Are you still working for the viagra people? They're raking in $45bn a year and spending around $32bn a year, which is around $60k a minute I think. 
     
    


29,July,2004


	 
      Hmm, having  looked into it (I am very bored) I couldn't find anywhere a rating of just how large this company is, or how many employees it has worldwide even. But I did find out that it's sales income is about 30 billion dollars a year, which makes me think that damo's theory about the million pounds a minute thing being rubbish is not rubbish.  In summary then, Chris.
     
    


29,July,2004

      Maybe I done did the math wrong in my head but that's over £125billion a year before profit...Microsoft only do around $20billion...sounds fishy to me! 
     
    


29,July,2004


	 
      Yeah, that was awesome, but only like two or three hot dogs I reckon.  I hope Dave's right about the making profit equation.  I am freaking bored, and everyone here seems to have gone home on their summer hours scheme.  What shall I do to pass the next two hours?

      I don't read the tabloids. I look at the pictures. The only reason I picked the Hewitt was that he was top of the 'movers and losers' list last divvy-day.  Honest.
     
    


29,July,2004


	 
      Yeah, ed sent me some links and a squad list for the proper telegraph game.  I can't remember if he told me which of the leagues we were going for, but either way picking my team was more entertainig than the work I was supposed to be doing.  I found out today that it costs one million pounds per minute of each working day worldwide to run the company I work for.  That's an expensive operation right there.
     
    


29,July,2004


	 
      well, it turns out that our pseudo-scottish snake-in-the-grass has been reading the tabloids the whole time. i think there should be an inquiry.  fonz, did ed mention that he and banksy are considering going for the on-line telegraph fanfoot this year? apparently you get a 18-man squad and that. it's supposubly better.  there was quite a good article on the bbc news web site last night about the bbfc and that. i agreed with it. although it quoted the professor of computer games at stafford university (or somesuch), which i thought devalued it a little.
     
    


29,July,2004


	 
      Well done for having the Hewitt.  I don't actually have access to the tabloids, so I was wondering why the hell he was top divi this week.  I concur with your rant.

"How will our amateurs do? Find out at the end of the program!" David then introduces a hardened cop..."So how long have you been in the business?" "Oh about 20 years"..."Anything caught your eye today?" "There's one in cell 3 with a fine set of teeth...it's going for about £30 quid...but is worth well over £60...imagine the fun you'd have putting your boot through those!" Two cops return, bright eyed and bushy tailed.&nbsp; Satsuma faced David turns to them "And what have you fellows picked up today then?" "Well, I've bought the one in cell 6 for £10...a bargain...come and look" David looks perplexed..."Oh deary deary me...sometimes you can't beat experience it has to be said...that looks like a half cast to me...you'll be lucky to make back half of what you paid at auction!" I can't be bothered to type anymore  &nbsp;

      i just saw three plain-clothes policemen take down a mugger on the opposite side of the street from me. there was lots of shouting, then they tackled him as he was running away. walkie-talkies and everything.  one of them just brought the car around. the mugger's sitting handcuffed on the pavement at the moment, and the bald copper keeps shouting "shut up! shut the fuck up" in his ear, and pushing him over.  it's like television. the whole neighbourhood's watching from its windows.

      80% of the work is done in 20% of the time. The other 20% of the work requires the remaining 80% of the time.  What that really means is that the easy stuff is easy to do, and the complicated stuff is usually not necessary. It's why when you're enjoying your work, people can see results, and when you're hating your work they keep asking you when they're going to see more results.  It's very handy because you can talk your way out of doing anything boring and time consuming.

      my guts have got some serious ache on. i think i can hear all the porcelain within a mile radius quailing.  i'm sure i have debbie does dallas somewhere. at least, debbie does dallas: the next generation. which is like the old one, but one of the characters is wearing tyre over his eyes.  yove: i've given up on my real work (re-creating the travel tables in the database) and i've started making some new buttons for the menu screens. i am king.

      Yes, and this new one never says anything about queer-ies. It has no sense of humour.

      It can certainly be a bit temperamental. Unlike the old BOA, which was perfect.
     
    


28,July,2004


	 
      I don't think I understand this new boa. I hit publish post, and it tells me that the blog doesn't exist anymore, then it posts my message twice.  I'm looking for another button to click but it's the only one i can see.

      I think  urlLink that  is good.  I feel sleepy and muzzy headed.  I have a sneaking suspicion it's from sitting in a beer garden drinking lager.

      i'm not sure whether  urlLink this  is good or not.  i feel bloaty. i bet it was that third sandwich.

      Dude, she's so fine I'd happily pay you a small fortune to come round and have a turn, broken legs or no.  I think this makes us both wrong in the head.
     
    


28,July,2004


	 
      Sorry Fonz, you went on so much about her...well - She's tied up in my wardrobe at the moment with a rag of cloth in her mouth.&nbsp; I hope one day to be able to untie her and let her roam free about my room...if the worst comes to the worst I may well break her legs but it's ok&nbsp;- she loves me so she'll understand

      Dude, that sucks.  It is fricking roasting here Mr Bigglesworth, so I've been drinking in the beer garden.  The good news?  I am drunk.  Tha bad news? I don't think the fit bar maid works at the pub anymore.  She was too good for us anyway...

      I don't know about that...Fonz's response had he been the interviewer would have been "You know someone that would pay for Fonz love?" 
     
    


28,July,2004


	 
      That was weird. At work, I couldn't see Yoav's message, hence my 'talking to himself' post. But at home it suddenly appeared in the past. I suspect witchcraft.  I think Fonz is equipped to be a prostitute.

      yes, but in lahndahn we have all things in the proper proportion (try saying that on a cold day), whereas everything in tokyo is tiny, tootiny.

      Apparently, Lahndahn is the second most expensive city in the world, behind Tokyo. And Tokyo-ites have a much better quality of life. This must mean that anyone who lives in Lahndahn must be the very end of the bell. The donger, if you will.

      What I am learning in America:  It is a portion of National Public Radio (NPR) interview between a female broadcaster and US Marine Corps General Reinwald who was about to sponsor a Boy Scout Troop visiting his military installation  FEMALE INTERVIEWER: So, General Reinwald, what things are you going to teach these young boys when they visit your base?  GENERAL REINWALD: We're going to teach them climbing, canoeing, archery, and shooting.  FEMALE INTERVIEWER: Shooting! That's a bit irresponsible, isn't it?  GENERAL REINWALD: I don't see why, they'll be properly supervised on the rifle range.  FEMALE INTERVIEWER: Don't you admit that this is a terribly dangerous activity to be teaching children?  GENERAL REINWALD: I don't see how. We will be teaching them proper rifle discipline before they even touch a firearm.  FEMALE INTERVIEWER: But you're equipping them to become violent killers.  GENERAL REINWALD: Well, you're equipped to be a prostitute, but you're not one, are you?  The radio went silent and the interview ended.

      The Metro suggested that it could be Smithers and Mr Burns getting hitched. I suggest that the writers of the Metro are idiots.  The SpaceShipOne team have set the dates for their attempts at the Ansari x-Prize. It's so exciting, I may be sick. Well, maybe not. I want to go into space, damnit!

      why would you wear red on a friday?! surely you knew the consequences of your savage actions?  how do you see at the moment, ross? are your wee eyeses all red and sore? like bloody pissholes in the snow?

      I've been to the New York Stock Exchange. We were there for closing. A bell rang, and everyone ran around like morons, then it was all over. It smelled of mansweat.
     
    


05,August,2004


	 
      I'm here for another... 7 hours. Goddammit.  I went to the New York Stock Exchange yesterday with another guy from the office. We were shown around by a broker. It's a pretty amazing place. It's just this huge room (with american flags hanging on the walls) and 1366 people in it. Actually it's one huge room and a few smaller rooms next to it.   There are no chairs, and basically at the sides of the room stand people who wait by the phone to get buy and sell orders. They get a call to buy shares of whatever, and they relay it to the guy who then goes to do it. He walks to something called a "post" which is a free standing circle of computer monitors reaching a few meters high, with about 5 people inside the circle and 5 people outside. Each person in a post trades between one and ten or so companies, so there are lots of posts dotted aruond the room. So he says to the person outside the post, I want to buy these shares, and he points to someone else nearby and says he wants to sell them, let's negotiate a price and we're done.  Of course this is all very hectic and completely a waste of time. The NASDAQ does it all electronically and these guys know that they're doomed. Every one of them that I talked to gave me a speech on why their particular function couldn't properly be repliacted by a computer and why they can still "add value to their clients".   So it was interesting. People in the office are blaming me for the market being down today because I'm wearing a red shirt.

I'm going to the Lake district for a race weekend tomorrow. I've got to run and cycle up mountains and canoe in lakes. It all has an endurance theme. It is going to be hell and i volenteered.

      I'd say you were funny and talented Dave.  And I am glad the damo "failed to nob" the Knightley last night.  I've done been to the pub, and it has taken me two minutes to type this sentence.  Bah.

      She's my precious! To be honest I can't remember which of the cells I've chained her in - When I find her I'll send her your way but it's highly likely she'll be pretty fucked up...it took rather a long time to convince her she loved me.

      Well we all knew that already. Are you a lawyer yet?  I'm going to the pub in a minute.  I still live in hope of the fit bar maid returning.  Come on damo, give her back.

      yes, she wandered into my office just after seven and started complaining to people that she had a metal plate in her head. they knew to send for me.  i had some interesting questions to answer this morning, i can tell you.

      Having spent 5 hours in the pub last night I came home to attempt something I have seen done on TV a few times.  After 1 hour, 5 flies and plenty of frustration I succeeded in attaching a small paper aeroplane via thin line to the back of a blue bottle fly.  It was a defining moment in my life and one I shall remember for years to come. My next effort will involve 5 or 6 flies with which I hope to stage some sort of Battle of Britain re-inactment.  It's amazing what interests you whilst drunk! Did you manage to find lexie in the end last night big 'un?

04,August,2004


	 
      Is that the word 'professional' used as an adjective to 'web developer'?  After working at CIS I didn't think there was such a thing!  Dave will explain, illegal spider racing and all.

      How dare you drastically resize my image Dave.  How would you like it if I resized something of yours?  And there's is no point now telling me I got an invite when I quite clearly didn't, it's called lying and it's not cool.  Anyway for those of you wondering what other amusing place names I happened to find on my travels you can look  urlLink here.  The photos of Bummer's Hill are still unfortunately in my camera.  Dave did promise me some from the gay orgy he attended there last month, but has not been forthcoming with the goods.  I recommend the  urlLink original web site  also.

      Yes, I thought that about the translators earlier, until I realised that to translate Japanese to English, you'd need to enter the Japanese in kanji, or at least hiragana.

      Another good one phonetically is "manko"...some japs won't understand "what the hell"..."manko" is universally understood - japanersally more to the point.

      I found out why I couldn't get Zatoichi from Blockbuster - it wasn't out on DVD until last week. Stupido Blockbuster.
     
    


03,August,2004


	 
      that sounds spot on. an elderly villager says it in zatoichi. i pissed myself at that point.
     
    


03,August,2004


	 
      I'm having a little trouble with this, as I can't view Japanese properly on my machine at work. I'll have a shufti when I get home.  However, I think the first one should be 'nan(i) da yo'. Nan, or sometimes nani, is 'what', 'da' is, informally, the existance of a thing, which isn't a verb in Japanese, and 'yo' adds emphasis at the end of a sentence. So it would be something like 'what (the hell) is that?', I think. 
     
    


03,August,2004


	 
      1st one depends on where the emphasis in your accent is...gentle it means "what the hell"...if you emphasise (phonetically) the "ooooo" bit at the end it become more like "what the fuck"  The second one is to commit severe "cunning linguist" on the mother "bitch" of your target.  By severe I mean getting the head down there and causing nastiness to come out.   Kani-Nabu-Chao-Chi-Bei is a phonetic equivalent of that in Chinese.  All though this one is for doing bad things to the dead relatives of your target...(cue: some tiresome jokes from fonz!) 
     
    


03,August,2004


	 
      well, the first thing is "what the hell?" or similar, and the second, i'm told, is the most offensive possible phrase in japanese.  start with looking up the kanji for "your mother's dead ancestors" and work backwards.
     
    


03,August,2004


	 
      What does it mean, though? If I knew the English, I could look stuff up.  Come on, you've piqued my interest now.  Also, I wish my fucking interweb connection would stop signing me out of Blogger when I try to post.

      s'welsh for ian. it is. anyway, i tole you on the tube that it was either ian or yoan, and you said you reckoned it was ewan. so i suppose we'll just have to kill each other.  ross, i've never seen my noise written down, i've only ever heard it, so i'm afraid that's the closest transliteration that i can manage.  go on, find the kanji now.
     
    


03,August,2004


	 
      Yes, but I was closer then your "Ian", and you had the cheek to pass yours off as fact.  More importantly, I knew you were wrong, which makes me keewwweelllll.
     
    


03,August,2004


	 
      wHAT DOES YOUR NOISE MEAN, THEN? i MIGHT WASTE SOME TIME LOOKING UP THE KANJI.  tHIS IS HOW EVERYONE WILL TYPE IN THE FUTURE. 
     
    


03,August,2004


	 
      you said he was called "ewan". that's not "yo-an".  ross, if you were real, i'd kick your ass for being so stupid.

      Just got a phone call from Lloyds TSB.  Someone tried to use my Credit Card to buy a £750 camera in Canada last week !  Luckily they caught it and didnt let it through. I lost £40 though as the exchange rate dropped a lot before it was refunded. I think the insurance covers it though.  Pain in the arse !

      Ikiru is the dictionary form, or present informal positive tense, of the verb to live, or exist. It looks like a group 2 (godan) verb, but is in fact a group 1 (ichidan), and so the present formal positive is ikirimasu, and not ikimasu as you'd expect.  Look upon my works, ye mighty, and despair!  Ozy-who-dias?
     
    


03,August,2004


	 
      Yeah, the bond fan has loads of kurosawa, including both those, but has thus far only lent me The Seven Samurai.  I might steal Ikiru pretty shortly, though.
     
    


03,August,2004


	 
      james has it - he brought it round. he's left me with ikiru, which has no samurai in it, yet is still a kurosawa film. bizarre, non?

      Have you got Yojimbo on DVD? I want to see it.
     
    


03,August,2004


	 
      he looked a bit old and buggered in zatoichi, but i put that down to him being old and buggered.  zatoichi is a good film. i watched yojimbo last night, and that is also a good film. but it made me want to watch sergio leone again.

      i need a new word.
     
    


03,August,2004


	 
      i resized it, although not very well. it's just a width and height property in the img tag.  today, i am rubbish. i need another weekend. although ideally not one spent being chased by bambos around some woods.  although that'll have to do.

      No, I haven't. I still need a computer case to actually build the machine before I can set it up. When I can be arsed, I'll find a cheapo case and put it together, then you can all give me useless, conflicting advice again.

      Who cleverly re-sized that image then, eh? Where is it hosted?  I haven't managed to make struts work.  But .NET does much the same thing, and that works a treat.  Ross, did you ever set up a server and your own website?  Or was our advice as useful as a chocolate thing that's not supposed to melt, but does because it's made of chocolate?
     
    


03,August,2004


	 
      tom, i sent you an invite ages ago to the board, but they expire after a few days i think, so if you missed it at the time then that was it. but you're here now, and that's what matters etc.  so tired, so sleepy. struts are QAF.

      OK, point taken.  I will try and use your/you're in the correct context, except when abusing Dave because it's even more offending when it sounds like it's from a fat, dumb, terrorised American.   Can we put HTML in here?

      Why?

I'm pretty sure I've never even made a transfer in fantasy football, because I never pay attention long enough to need to.
     
    


02,August,2004


	 
      Quick, let's make Ross go to  urlLink www.tffo.co.uk  and sign up for a fantasy football team.

      Doom 3 - now there's some scary shit. I'm surprised it's had such a negative response so far. I've only played a couple of hours, but it seems awesome like several hotdogs so far.

      have you clicked on mini-league, lamo?
     
    


12,August,2004


	 
      I'm not even in the league at the moment I don't think as I can't see anyone? 
     
    


12,August,2004


	 
      Personally, I'd have opted for something like "There's a challenge I can't refuse", but at least Lazer's version makes some sense.  Our league might have as many as 13 people in soon.  So if anyone has the ability to sign up 7 more, we'd get a free trophy at the end of the season.
     
    


12,August,2004


	 
      Dave, Fonz and Ross have probably suffered a heart attack as a result of your double negative.  I'm surprised you didn't not know this! 
     
    


12,August,2004


	 
      Well, I couldn't not accept a challenge like that from my nemesis.  Twill do it tonight.  Was intending to go out and try and put away some 30 year old Italian language student but, considering this and the fact I'm off on a stag this weekend, it can wait till next week.  Is the double negative alright for you there Ross?
     
    


12,August,2004


	 
      Damn, I forgot all about Bridgestock.  I guess that means I'm not going.  Bells.  Tom, we need you to sign up to the  urlLink fan foot  league, and we need you to do it  today !  The season starts tomorrow, so get with the program and round out our league for us.  You can't rest on your laurels from last time when you claim to have finished 4th without managing your team.  Lies.

      I went to a strip joint with work last night...it was great.  I am hungover as hell today though - tonight I go to Bridgestock and a weekend of partying with 30 or so other people...not sure I can handle it at the moment. And the weather is shit

      I was going to play but I see Sawston Rovers isn't among one of the teams from which you can choose players.  As a result I cannot choose myself, Spence, Saggs, Shoulders, Steve, Sam Simon or Big Dave and so can't really see myself picking any team that will do very well.  Although last time I did come fourth having forgotten about my team three days into the season.

      That's nothing, the mighty Gills beat Leeds last night at home. Myabe we won't suck so hard this season.  Manx, did you use your hotmail address to sign up to Fan Foot?  If not, you need to let Dave know which e-mail address you used, and he'll put you in the mini-league.

      F*** Me Dave, the U's actually managed a home draw last night!  Although there seems to be some confusion on 'the Internet' over where they played.  Isn't Brisbane Road Orient's home ground?

      Hmm, i'm unlikely to maintain interest all season enough to keep changing players every week.  anyway I picked all the same 11 i have in my work fantasy team then i added 7, which gives me a pretty balanced squad anyway.  do i need to be added to a mini leage then?

      That was my thinking, until I realised I could afford more than 11 really good players.  The trick is, you can select players for Saturday AND Sunday games, so you can get all 18 of your players to play each week if you get it right.  But if seven of them are bollocks, you'll only get 11 of them playing.

      Re: Fantasy League  Is there any reason not to just buy 11 really good players and make the other 7 a bunch of cheap Crystal Palace losers. Do only 11 score for you at a time?

      "Ross wins" is the phrase you're after.  I've said it before and I'll say it again, everyone should sign up to the Premiership at  urlLink www.tffo.co.uk .  Do you think we should drop manx a note about it?

      where are the paint-tanks and paint-artillery-strikes?  i am a very wet boy this morning. the light shower when i left the flat quickly became a torrential downpour. my shoes are not, it turns out, waterproof, and nor am i.  it's unpleasant.

      I'd also quite like it if there were medics who ran around wiping paint off for you - If they manage it within 30 seconds you live...obviously this is a shit idea but it would allow me to shout "Reviiive me" as well as the statutory "I neeeed Ammo"

      As I lack the skill and know how of those that play paint ball all the time the only real chance I had of victory against a team of profs last year was to purchase a shedload of ammo.  Fed up with losing, on the last game myself and three friends spent around £30 each on ammunition.  We were protecting the base...we spent the whole game firing continuously...there's nothing like hearing 4 or 5 of the opposition shouting "You'll run out of ammo soon" from behind a tree then 5 minutes later see them make a last ditch charge into a hail of gunfire. Next time I hope to discover the No_Clipping Mode so I can run through trees.  I don't think I'll bother with God_Mode though as it will probably make it all a bit too easy.

      I'll have you know I was a fucking ninja in one paintball game, when I single-handedly stormed a temple and took out four bastards, and then got some stirling backup from Wee Dave and his sister, and we took out another two or three.  Of course, when I got shot and went back to the elimination zone, there were only three opposing players there. You do the math.

      they're sly, these dawgs. still, ross and i heroically hid in our base during one game, and were shot to shit in the bushes.  they gunned up my knees, the bastards.

      Do you remember I got done for pistol whipping those guys who wiped paint off themselves and then shot me back at close range.  No point going if your going to have to play against a bunch of chavs.

      i am a bad, bad soldier. i'm too big a target, and crouching makes my knees hurt.  i got the cack shot out of me.  still, we were playing against a bunch of cheating army-boys, who HAD A FUCKING PASSWORD and wiped paint off themselves when there was no marshal around. it wasn't as much fun as i'd hoped.  but dave was a winner. a WINNER.

      Got it from Game...they tend to deliver between 3 and 7 days before UK release date -tis good.  Got a mail today that it was dispatched for next day delivery this morning...Think the site is  urlLink www.game.uk.com .  Only time I buy games is if I want to do the multiplayer stuff...else I would have downloaded Doom.

      Dave, apparently you are an Edinburgh virgin and your going for the first time with Billy!  I must warn you when me and Patrick went up there for a few days we got pissed on the plane on the way up and didn't return to sobriety until at least twelve hours after we'd crossed south of the border.  This was mainly due to Bartram showing off his enhanced student lifestyle where if he wasn't at the radio station he was either in an establishment that specialised in the sale of alcohol or at home where his fridge contents consisted solely of Stella, Vodka and Cranberry Juice!  Plus you are going for some Whiskey tasting do!

      I've played it for about 7 hours now in an optimum environment of small dark room encrusted with speakers on my own and the more I play it the more boring it gets. There is literaly no variety - all the rooms look the same the monsters are dull and very very stupid. The weapons are crap and its not scary. Its pretty but not ridiculously so and it really is a big tech demo to make people licence the engine. As such it should be free and you shouldn't buy it. Just download the fucker and get bored with it and imagine what companies will do with the engine.  So there.

      Yeah, it's not the sort of game you play with other people around though to properly experience...it probably takes a reasonable amount of time to get into as well.  Either way it's got to be better than Soldner which sucked complete monkey balls.
