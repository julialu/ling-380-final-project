      I never used to have friends over to my parent's house while growing up.  Now that I'm older there seems to be no problem with having a few friends over for many, many beers.  Here's Ryan in his traditional pose - lounging with a beer in hand.   urlLink    Ryan Drinking A Beer&nbsp; urlLink

      This is one of my favorite pictures I've taken of the Stutson Street Bridge.  Even though it's old, seemingly rickety, and noisy, I'll still miss it when they knock it down.   urlLink    Stutson Street Bridge at Sunset&nbsp; urlLink

      So,  urlLink Julia  and  urlLink I  seem to be on the same wavelength all the damn time.  About a half an hour ago, we were chatting about all the photos we have, but that we never have enough time to send them to each other, not to mention all of our other friends who should see them.  And so the brainstorming began (our intellects are SO dizzying).  This Blog is the product of the aforementioned brainstorming.       urlLink    The inspirational photo for our new blog.  Here we go!  Whee.......!!!!    Our hope is that all of our friends will also post their photos.  Keeping in touch just got a little easier.  And more fun!    Julia, I promise not to publish anything incriminating unless you say it's ok.  *winks*

       urlLink    The only way to hula-hoop.  (Susan)  Sunday evening, we went over to Ben and Susan's for dinner.  After several beers, Susan decided we should all take a turn on the piano and each do 2 songs.  Instead, Susan and I ended up, by ourselves, playing drunken Ben Folds (what else?) tunes.  My punishment?  An episode of  urlLink Black Adder .  I won't do it again, I promise!  Can't wait for Friday's  urlLink The Big Lebowski  viewing, complimented by the consumption of many, many White Russians.   urlLink    Ben grilling in the dark.  We all hoped against hope the burgers would only be slightly pink.
