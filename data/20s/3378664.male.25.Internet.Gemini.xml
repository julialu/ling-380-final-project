      I just registered www.conordoyle.com.  I was surprised that it was available and snatched it up as quick as possible.  Look for this blog to move to a new home shortly.   After checking the stats, it looks like I'm still talking to myself here.  Drop me a line and let me know I'm not.  BTW -  urlLink Andy Kaufman  is apparently alive and well in NYC!

      I just posted a new image on my  urlLink deviantart page .    urlLink     This is my oldest daughter, Kayla   I posted the image to take part in the  urlLink DA-Digital  solitude contest on Deviantart.  Secondly, I've been testing out my new  urlLink gmail account  and must say I like it.  There are still some bugs that need to be worked out of the system, but the interface is cool, the functionality is revolutionary, and the fact that it is  urlLink Google  is awesome.  Let me know what you think about the image (or images).  Conor

      This is my first official blog post ever. I've never kept a journal or been very good at writing about myself, but we'll give this a shot.  Some quick background info on me:  Age: 25 Marital Status: Married Children: 2 girls (Kayla and Molly) Pets:  2 Cats  I am currently a webmaster/web admin for a company called  urlLink Aquascape Designs , out of Batavia, Illinois.  We sell equipment for backyard ponds and water gardens.  It's a great, growing company and I've been here for 6 years.  My current passion is for photography.  My website will have a portfolio of pictures.  For now you can see them at  urlLink my deviantart page .   Well that should do it for my initial post.  I look forward to being active here.  Conor

       urlLink CNN.com - Spanky the clown arrested on porn charges   It makes me sick to see stuff like this.  Makes you want to endorse things like the death penalty, caning, or ritualistic torture.  I've currently have 5-6 registered sex offenders living within 4 miles of my house.  You can't go anywhere without running into this stuff.

       urlLink Wired News : "Before President George W. Bush orders the demolition of Abu Ghraib, he might want to learn how to pronounce the name of the infamous site of the Iraqi prison abuse scandal. During Bush's half-hour television address Monday, he mangled the name of the notorious prison each of the three times he mentioned it, despite having rehearsed the speech twice. To his credit, Abu Ghraib is an easy name to garble. The correct pronunciation sounds like 'ah-BOO grehhb,' with the second word beginning with a guttural, phlegmy 'gh' sound. The pronunciation-impaired president, however, first called the prison 'abugah-rayp.' His second attempt came out 'abu-garon,' and his final utterance sounded something like 'abu-garah.' Too bad Camp Redemption didn't stick.  -- Jenny McKeel "

      I spend 40+ hours a week trying to get the website of the company I work for ( urlLink www.aquascapedesigns.com ) to be in the top 10 for our certain keywords.  I've, so far, gotten only 1 keyword phrase in the top 50.  Now with no effort, and only a few weeks, I've gotten my blog into the number 1 spot in  urlLink Google  for  Conor Doyle .    I guess you can't win all the time. :-)
