      La la la connect the dots.  Hello, I'm eight. Actually, I'm twenty-four, if we are talking about age. Years, that is...twenty-four years old. My name, however, is eight. Nice to meet you. This is an endeavor. I'm not completely sure of the purpose yet, but that will all be revealed in time. I would like to personally welcome you to RANDOM by seven eight, and I hope you will come back to share in the adventures to come!  Have a nice day.  ::8::

      I like to sleep until noon every day, every day, every day. I am a lazy a$$. Lazy. That is me. Lazy eight.  BLAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH.  Did you say something? I think I'll get dressed now, seeing how it's nearly 3 in the afternoon and I'll feel like a total loser soon if I don't. Winky.

      It's no fun when you want to do something with you best friend (8), but she's still asleep, and you have to wait till she gets up.  But it's ok, because there's lots of music to listen to, and lots of internet posts to reply to.  Dave Matthews Band is the biggest bomb, diddly, yo, in the Universe!

I can't wait for 8 to come home.&nbsp; it's more fun when we're hyper together.&nbsp; it's no fun when you're hyper alone.&nbsp; there's no one to laugh at you.&nbsp; that's the key.&nbsp; yo.
