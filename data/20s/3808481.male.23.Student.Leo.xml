      Well the cable modem wasnt working very consistly, it would pretty much only work at night for some reason. But the comcast guy came out and fixed it. There was a loose connection on the box up the street. So yay, i have internet again.

      Well my bro said he had an extra ticket to the DMB concert last night so i was able to get that for free too. It almost seems like all the free stuff is going to cancel out all the expensive crap i have to buy for my motorcycle.

      yeah i suck with human, i am not sure what it is, but i seem so slow with them. *sigh* and they seems so cool too. I think they ahve the best units in the game with the spellbreakers and their starting tower is cool too. I think they just take too much micro and i am not that good at that.

      I went and saw that with my girl tonight. I thought it was really good, but she didnt much care for it. We saw Spiderman 1 right before it on HBO so we had a good feeling for the plot. I wont give anything away since so many people read this site. HA HA HA

      I am now using Firefox as my browser:   urlLink Download here   I think i like it, it seems a bit slower then IE, but then again i hacked my IE to make it download more images faster. At least Firefox is less problematic to hackers and expolits and i am not supporting microsoft.

      Well trying to find the solution to my cable modem lock up lead me to this thread:   urlLink Cable modem Lock up Problems   and now i think i am either going to try to talk to tech support or buy a new modem like the motorolla surboard sb5100. maybe i will talk to nick and see whats going on. Any other suggestions on a good cable modem that doesnt lock up after heavy use?
