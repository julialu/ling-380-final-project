      2:12AM 11/13.   I am watching Martha Stewart make some kind of mushroom dishes.  I really have an issue with cleaning mushrooms with only a dry paintbrush.  How is that going to clean it?  OH NO!  Good ole' Rachel Ray is on this commercial.  LOL.  She is so damn hilarious.  I just got back from the store getting cigarettes.  I really need to quit smoking.  Oh well..maybe when I secure a job I will be able too.  'SO' is in the other room asleep.  He is having back issues so he needs to sleep on a firm mattress.  The doggie is in bed with me.  He is already asleep.  I have to get up at around 9ish tomorrow so I can go mail that book.    More later....maybe!

      Can I just tell you how I hate when Scott picks the movies to watch?  It is always like X-Men, Spiderman, or the dreaded KILL BILL!!!  I hate that movie.  The other's I can stand, but only like once a year.  Please help!!!
