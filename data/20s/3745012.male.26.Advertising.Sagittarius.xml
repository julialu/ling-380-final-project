      I'm going tonight!  Can't wait.  I will post a review of the movie after I see it.  I'm hoping it's another Xmen 2 and tops the first on all levels.

       urlLink Mozilla releases web browser updates - ja.zz   Everyone should be using Firefox for their main web browser these days.  IE is just too insecure and you are just asking for spyware.

      I admit it.  There are millions of blogs out there.  Hell I am sure there are hundreds of them that cover just about the same thing I am going to.  So why bother?  Well I guess I just wanted a place to toss all my random thoughts on stuff that interests me.  You are going to see a lot of  urlLink Firefly  stuff on here, no lie.  What you are also going to see are my thoughts on all things Buffyverse, comics, movies, and TV.  I will make no bones about it.  I am sure at the end of the day I will be lucky to attract one or two "followers," but it does not hurt to try.  -J
