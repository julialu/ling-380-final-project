        urlLink    A small castle in Mont Beron north of Toulouse. If it wasn't a hospital for mentally ill and we had won in Lotto, we'd buy it!

        urlLink    Picture from Toulouse plage Saturday night. It's a great place, but sadly it closes already at one o'clock. Now that the neighbours have started to complain about the noice they are playing music at a very low volume which is a bit sad.

        urlLink    I am neither embarrassed nor tired, but simply relaxing after having walked around Toulouse an entire day. When you have visitors you get an effective work out by walking around the entire town and explaining some of the history of the town.

        urlLink    No, this picture is not from some sort of morbid sex shop, but from a shop for hairdressers. I wonder how people react when someone walks out of the shop with one of these heads under the arm!

        urlLink    Some lunatic has put a red substance in our fountain and sprayed the text "prison kills" on it. I have no freakin idea what good that serves and the person doesn't even have a clear message. Put that person in jail and then it'll be his/hers problem whether or not prison kills.

        urlLink    Now this is something you don't really get to do in Denmark. Hanging out by a pool at night is great and the fact that it can be open about half of the year is just so darn sweet.

        urlLink    Ok I know that it's a bit unclear,but it's a picture of a message board at a French bus stop. The nice bus people have indicated how the customers can get in contact with the company and one of the contact options is mail. Great, but what the heck is up with the lack of an email address? They simply write www.semvat.com, which either means that they have no idea what the difference between email and websites is or that they want to hide the email address on their website to avoid getting too much customer feedback.
