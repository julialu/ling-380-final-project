       urlLink    Recognize this sign? Think Seinfeld. It's really called Tom's Restaurant (they just cut the Tom part out for the show). Walked all the way from 30 something street to 112th just to eat dinner here. Inside it looks completely different from the show.

       urlLink    I arrived in San Pedro Sula on May 23, 2004. I met a woman named Nelly on my plane and she offered to drive me into the city, to a hotel. &nbsp; urlLink    
     
    


23,June,2004


	 
       urlLink    This was funny for me. I thought this was more of the way they carry things in the country, not in the city. &nbsp; urlLink    
     
    


23,June,2004


	 
       urlLink    I met Dilcia (and her energy-packed son, Stuardo) at the hotel where I stayed in San Pedro. Immediately she took me under her wing and guided me around while I was there. She insisted on paying for my cab rides and got me a little keychain to remember her. I was there for only a day. What a great start for my trip. &nbsp; urlLink

       urlLink    Indiginous women in the Central Park at Antigua. They were there to sell their goods and were all over the place in Antigua. Guatemala, in general, is home to the largest population of indiginous people in Central America. &nbsp; urlLink    
     
    


23,June,2004


	 
       urlLink    The most common picture taken at the ever famous market of Chichicastenango. This is a must see for anyone who goes to Guatemala. Every Thursday and Sunday is the market day in "Chichi." Thousands of Quiche Mayans come to town to buy and sell. The market is said to be the largest native market in North America. At the top of these stone stairs is the church (see next picture).&nbsp; urlLink    
     
    


23,June,2004


	 
       urlLink    Inside the church, the people practice a religion called Santeria. It is a combination between Catholicism and African Voodo.

       urlLink    Lago Atitlan--"The Most Beautiful Lake in the World." The picture captures one of the three volcanoes that surrounds the lake. Rumor has it that Bono has a house here. And I took this photo from Panajachel, the hippie meca of the 70's. I still saw some remaining hippie's riding their bikes and walking along the streets of this town. &nbsp; urlLink    
     
    


23,June,2004


	 
       urlLink    One of the many baptisms in the lake that day. This lake seems to be seen as a holy place for religious followers. &nbsp; urlLink

23,June,2004


	 
       urlLink    That night, after I got home from the lake, Mariachis came to our house to celebrate the return of one of the husbands of the house. He had been working for 2 years in Texas. Almost 20 friends and family were there to celebrate. The man (who had just returned) made me dance with him (in front of everyone) several times. Quite an embarassing moment, i must say. &nbsp; urlLink    
     
    


23,June,2004


	 
       urlLink    This is the ever popular temple of Maximon in San Andres Itzapa. Maximon tends to be a religion of the indiginous people as well as prostitutes. Maximon is a cross between a Mayan god and Judas Iscariot. He is the smoking and drinking god who rules death, healing, crossroads, fertility and male sexual power. Some appropriate offerings are...incense, candles, money, roosters, tortillas, rum, cigars, silk scarves, coca-cola, citrus-scented perfume and herbs. &nbsp; urlLink    
     
    


23,June,2004


	 
       urlLink    Followers perform the spiritual ceremony (some consider it to be witchcraft), while silently praying to Maximon. &nbsp; urlLink

23,June,2004


	 
       urlLink    The sign says there is a Q5,000 fine (approx $625) for throwing trash over the ledge...A little boy gets rid of his waste in his wheelbarrow. The next pic is a view over the ledge. &nbsp; urlLink

23,June,2004


	 
       urlLink    An evangelist preaches for almost 45 minutes on the crowded chicken bus. &nbsp; urlLink    
     
    


23,June,2004


	 
       urlLink    I met up with Angie (we went to UM together) in Antigua the previous night. We spent that day together at the toro. We were the only two white people on the fence, let alone, part of the minority of women that were not in the stands.  &nbsp; urlLink    
     
    


23,June,2004


	 
       urlLink    Black bull stares blankly. &nbsp; urlLink    
     
    


23,June,2004


	 
       urlLink    The bull comes charging to our corner. Everyone jumps up onto the fence (including our laps) and kicks the bull to taunt him. This one's a little guy.&nbsp; urlLink    
     
    


23,June,2004


	 
       urlLink    Our fence almost fell down while we were on it and everybody ran to the rescue to put up another post to support it. &nbsp; urlLink    
     
    


23,June,2004


	 
       urlLink    This is before it got super crowded. Mostly women and children stayed in the bleacher section while the men and young boys were either on the fence or in the ring. &nbsp; urlLink
