      Okay, here's a good javascript we used at work a few days ago to end-around a problem we were running into.  I'll post the code, then the breakdown of what the code does.    (javascript start and end tags have been removed, on account of stupid blogger script.  Will write my own webpage someday, when I have time...)  	 		var strname = location.href; 		var pos1 = strname.indexOf(".asp");  		var pos2 = strname.indexOf(".asp");  		var part1 = strname.substring(0,pos1); 		var part2 = part1 + "_report"; 		var part3 = strname.substring(pos2); 		var part4 = part2 + part3;		 		document.write("View Printable Report".link(part4)) 	  Here was the dilemma.  We had a form online that we needed to link to a 'printable version.'  Since all the data was coming from the same database, all we needed to do was send the users to a different address.  Problem was, we coudln't hard-code the address because, depending on where the user was logged in, they could be hitting it from a different address.  We needed a script that would grab the current address from the browser, clip it, and insert '_report' into a specific place in the middle of the address.    Here's the breakdown:  var strname = location.href;  //This gives the variable 'strname' the value of the address in the browser.    var pos1 = strname.indexOf(".asp");  //This tells the script that the variable 'pos1' is everything included in 'strname' up to '.asp' in the address.  Basically it says "Hey, stop taking data when you hit '.asp' (which is where we needed to do the clip.  var pos2 = strname.indexOf(".asp");  //I needed a second variable at the same place, in order to tell the script, after I've added in my string to the address, to tell it where to pick up and use the rest of the address.  Trust me, it'll make sense.  var part1 = strname.substring(0, pos1);  //Names 'part1' as everything up to '.asp' in the address bar  var part2 = part1 + "_report";  //Actually adds '_report', the data I needed to add into the string, into the address  var part3 = strname.substring(pos2);  //Tells the string now to start up again, with the '_report' added in  var part4 = part2 + part3;  //Tells the machine to add the first half "http://somename.keylogic.com/_report" to the rest of the address ".asp?cgi=somelocation"  document.write("View Printable Report".link(part4))  //Tells the machine that the hyperlink for 'View Printable Report' goes to the variable named in 'part4'  Basically writes the completed hyperlink, with the added part.   This is handy to allow users to grab an address, especially if the address is housed in older asp or cgi, where each user's id is stored in the address, but you want to do other, more dynamic things with that user's info without lots of database coding.  Javascript is the duct tape of the internet.

      There is a great example of Sophistry which comes, oddly enough, from Star Trek: The Next Generation.    I should say, as a foreward, that I fucking hate Star Trek.  It's a good show, but I'm not what one would call a "TV Watcher," so Star Trek automatically gets lumped in with Fear Factor and CSI:  Ghent, WV.  At any rate, it still has great writing and usually slips good themes in every episode.  The example of Sophistry is the following (if I can remember it all in detail):  The gang is hovering over a planet, trying to figure out a way to 'lawfully' get some aleins from a dying world onto the ship.  They're going to violate the Prime Directive if they just beam down, so they need to either 1

      Was watching the Democratic Convention tonight when one of the worst catchphrases that these capitalist scumfucks like to spew about came up.    The phrase was "Hardworking Americans."  I'll use it in a sentence.  "John Kerry cares not only for the plight of the 'haves and have-mores' like President Bush, but he also cares for the well-being of hardworking Americans."  Lemme tell you something.  "Hardworking Americans" really means "poor people."  John Kerry (rich dude, who I'm voting for BTW) cares just as much about poor folks as he does rich folks.  Wow.  Thanks for that insight.    I was in the kitchen when I heard the phrase, and immediately yelled in "That's bullshit.  Show me an American that's not hardworking!  They're fucking everywhere.  They're EVERYONE!  We're ALL hardworking Americans!  Show me someone who's not a hardworking American!"  Dave, my roommate, who was in the living room, raised his hand.  Poor Dave, you've gotta love him.  He has Raisinets for balls, but at least he knows his plight.  I damn near spilled my icewater when I came in the living room and saw him with his hand up.    "Well yeah, except you, show me an American who's not hardworking!"    That's what I love about politicians.  They can basically say "Fuck you" and say it in such a way so that almost everyone doesn't even realize what's going on.    Just remember, anytime you hear one of these political scumfucks talking about "Hardworking Americans" they're setting you up, getting ready to tell you how they're going to use the "Ron Jeremy Model" dildoe on ya.

      "Amigo, the only thing in this world that gives orders is balls.  Balls.  You got that?" - Tony Montana  I fucking *hate* people with no balls.    People who run at the first sign of trouble, but love talking about their own issues.  People who like to point out the glaringly obvious, and call themselves insightful when they, like a drunk crawling through his own piss and shit, manage to string together a sentence between their uncontrollable manic urges and drippingly pathetic self-loathing worldview.  Listen, grow a pair, and get your life together.  Get a job, put the fork down, and learn how to be a fucking man.  Things will go much easier for you when you take responsibility for your actions, ownership for your current situation, and charge of your future.    And the thing I love the most is when people ask "You're not talking about me, are you?"    Here's a news flash, if you have to ask that question, then odds are I AM talking about you.  Of COURSE I'm talking about you.    Last thing on this departure that I hear all the time.  "I'm just dealing with too much to think about that right now."  Guess what?  EVERYONE has shit they're dealing with.  You can define Life as:  Life:     Shit you're dealing with.  Everyone on earth has had it rough (with the exception of President Dubya and his fucking elitist retarded capitalist scumfucks in Washington).  Your uniqueness does not come from the hardships you've had to deal with in your life.  Your uniqueness comes from how you get over it, from fighting through it.  If you're so in love with your hardships that they define who you are, then your balls are nothing more than a pair of atrophied raisins that are no more good to you than your appendix.

         Most of you know that Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance is one of the most significant books in my life.  I've read, re-read, loved, and worn thin that book.  I'm on my second copy, a cheap $7.99 paperback that I got from Walden's back in November.  The spine is pretty banged up, and there's blue ink on it from where it had the unfortunate luck of being in my backpack when a pen exploded.     But pages 258 and 259 are the subject tonight.  It'll make this kind of a long post, but goddam it's worth it.       "Highway 13 follows another branch of our river but now it goes upstream past old sawmill towns and sleepy scenery.  Sometimes when you switch from a federal to a state highway it seems like you drop back like this in time.  Pretty mountains, pretty river, bumpy but pleasant tar road ... old buildings, old people on a front porch ... strange how old, obsolete buildings and plants and mills, the technology of fifty and a hundred years ago, always seem to look so much better than the new stuff.  Weeds and grass and wild flowers grow where the concrete has cracked and broken.  Neat, squared, upright lines acquire a random sag.  The uniform masses of the unbroken color of fresh paint modify to a mottled, weathered softness.  Nature has a non-Euclidian geometry of her own that seems to soften the deliberate objectivity of these builings with a kind of random spontaneity that architects would do well to study.     "Soon we leave the river and the old sleepy buildings and now climb to some sort of a dry, meadowy plateau.  The road rolls and bumps and rocks so much I have to keep the speed down to fifty.  There are some bad chuckholes in the asphalt, and I watch carefully for more.     "We're really accustomed to making mileage.  Stretches that would have seemed long back in the Dakotas now seem short and easy.  Being on the machine seems more natural than being off it.  We're nowhere that I'm familiar with, in country that I've never seen before, yet I don't feel a stranger to it.     "At the top of the plateau at Grangeville, Idaho, we step from the blasting heat into an air-conditioned restaurant.  Deep cool inside.  While we wait for chocolate malteds I notice a high-schooler sitting at the counter exchanging looks with the girl next to him.  She's gorgeous, and I'm not the only other one who notices it.  The girl behind the counter waiting on them is also watching with an anger she thinks no one else sees.  Some kind of triangle.  We keep pasing unseen through little moments of other people's lives.     "Back in the heat again and not far from Grangeville we see that the dry plateau that looked almost like prairie when we were out on it suddenly breaks away into an enormous canyon.  I see our road will go down and down through what must be a hundred hairpin turns into a desert of broken land and crags.  I tap Chris's knee and point and as we round a turn where we see it all I hear him holler, "Wow!"     "At the brink I shift down to third, then close the throttle.  The engine drags, backfiring a little, and down we go.     "By the time our cycle has reached the bottom of wherever it is we are, we have dropped thousands of feet.  I look back over my shoulder and see antlike cars way back at the top.  Now we must head forward across this baking desert to wherever the road leads."     When I first read that back in high school, I stopped dead.  I literally couldn't read the book for the rest of the day.  Perfection, like simple choices, is a rare thing.  Being able to see someone so clearly say something so profound, with never actually saying anything related to their target, is astounding.  I could smell the gas from the motorcycle, could feel the heat baking off the road, and could smell the artificially sweet smell of the air-conditioned restaurant.  Usually with a book, I'm bouncing from one topic to the next, always begging for the next subject.  To be stopped cold, and to get 'it' so clearly, took the book from one of my favorites to the best I've ever read.     I mean, I can tell you how good "The Stand" or "On the Road" is, but it's because of the cumulative story.  I can't point to one page and go "there!"       And also, it speaks to my traveling spirit.  I'm taking road trips more often now, just to kind of quell it.  I like where I am right now, and where I'm going, but I feel a need to move again.  Taking random trips across half the country makes it better.

       urlLink Lynndie England   This is a picture of Lynndie England, one of the Abu Ghraib fucktards that decided to shame our country by acting like idiots.  Take a long look at this picture.  These are the people that we send to die for us.  Barely-educated simpletons that don't understand exactly what it is they've gotten themselves into.  Nothing in this world has changed since the times of the Pharoahs.  We still have slaves (they work at Wal-Mart and Burger King) and we still have a serf class that fights our battles for us.  Lynndie England is the failure of America.  She is a serf, working to provide amenities for rich people, fighting in Iraq for the ideals of liars and gluttons, and abadoned by her country because she is a simpleton.

      The best endings to movies, all-time.  Since the only person I agree 100% with is myself, you can comment, but you'll also have to acknowledge that I'm right.  5

      "A Jedi must have the deepest commitment, the most serious mind."  - Yoda  It's a funny phrase, especially since a 3 ft. tall sock puppet has the same philosophy as those Zen and Taoist monks and whatnot.    I have seen people, especially in these recent, tiresome months, who have forgotten their commitment.  You cannot make a promise, whether it is spoken or not, and then forget about it.  You must understand that your actions make statements, even when those statements are not what you want to say.  I myself regret terribly some of the things I did just a few months ago.  I had to go into my shell, take time for myself, and figure out what it was I was doing, and why I was doing it.  I did things that I should not have done, and now I'm faced with the idea of having to deal with those consequences, whatever they may end up being, for a very long time.  Especially for a guy who's driving force in life has been making up for bad things he's done before, this is the worst of the worst things to do.  Forgetting the 'why' and focusing only on the moment causes serious consequences.    Fortunately for me, they're consequences that aren't all-ecompassingly bad (and I realize that may not be a word, fuck you).  All I have to do is live with the decisions I've made, and hope I can do better next time.  I am at peace with the decisions I've made, even the bad ones.  It's why it's so frustrating seeing people, especially people who have worked their way into your life, make similar mistakes.  It's hard watching people do things, do things to you, that you know they're going to regret.  It hurts, and it also makes you angry.  There is an overlying ideal of "Right" in the world, and when someone tramples on your life, and when someone ignores the commitments they've made, they're ignoring "Right."  It makes you angry, and sad, and full of pity, when you see people ignore "Right" for the impulse.  It's why I always say, "I try to be a nicer person."    I just wish people knew how what they do affects everyone.  I wish people understood that they do not live in a shell, and that their actions affect everyone else, no matter how much they try to keep it from happening.  Just understand what your actions say, and don't act surprised when someone who 'takes things seriously' starts taking things seriously.    Oh, and last thing.  Assumption is the mother of all fuck-ups.  Don't assume I'm talking about one person in particular.  Don't assume I'm talking about one situation, odds are you don't even fucking know what it is.  It all goes back to the idea of caring about a person, not caring about what that person can give you.  Ask yourself, when was the last time I asked "How are you doing?" and actually cared about the answer?
