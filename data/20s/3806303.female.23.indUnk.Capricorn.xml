      David bowie once said in the song Lets Dance:   "if you say run i'll run with you"   I wanna dance... but not the dancing he had in mind... i want to dance with the moon howl at it   to cringe and make people cry if need be... when the mood took me when it took them..  blah and so it goes and so it goes....
