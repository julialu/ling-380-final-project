       urlLink    A 300 plus mile road trip through Kansas gives you lots of things to look at. However this was not expected. We saw two stealth bombers flying around over the Lyons KS area today. Why? I don't know why. They are stationed over  in MO. Kansas has an old Bombing range not to far from my location when I shot these. Maybe they were out practicing or something. It would suck to have one of these fly up on you if your Taliban or something. BOOM!&nbsp; urlLink

      Yo! Today on the way to work was interesting. It was pouring rain so hard that I couldn't the car in front of me. I was thinking 'Pile up on west Kellogg' but thankfuly that didn't happen. I know that I was in control of my car, but everyone else out there is a different story. I got soaked in the parking lot walking in to work. The next crew to walk in after the 6:30 crew (mine) was dry as could be. Puts a new meaning to the saying "rain on your parade". But whatever. After work I am going to The Yard hardware store with Justin to check out some stuff. He is building some customer speaker boxes for his Nissan Z, and I know they have a million things that he might be interested in looking at. I think we might be rolling out to Home Depot to look into some wood as well. I plan on shooting a few pictures in either location. Should be interesting. My friend and fellow www.5ksummer.com comrad, MDX told me that he got kicked out of the Gap for shooting pictures in there. I went there this past weekend took one picture. As soon as the shutter was done, this dude came up and was real interested in me as a client offering me help with this and help with that. I only took that one picture, but I wonder what would have happened if I took more. Jess was with me so I didn't want to push the issue and possibly get kicked out. She is not hip with me doing that sort of thing. Really though, I cannot blame her. I spoke with Catherine from Syracuse last night on the net. It had been a while and it was good to chit chat. For those of you who don't know her it is Jessica's brother, Mark's girlfriend. She is a phototograjunkie like me. She was looking for a free place on the net to pose thousands of pictures. Anyone have any ideas on that, just let me know.  This turkey dinner is good.

       urlLink    The normal things we all take for granted everyday make the best images. I drive past this fence everyday and never noticed its textures until I snapped this off. The shading, repetition, and contrast in this fence caught me off guard being that it was 'just a fence'. Captured on flim it turned into a world of texture. Anyhow I like this picture. Go outside take a few and enjoy.&nbsp; urlLink

       urlLink    I really like rainy days, and today is a nice one. I never really feel like shooting pictures on these days so I am taking this one off. It better not rain for the next few days because I plan on taking loads of pictures.&nbsp; urlLink

      Today on my way to work the cloud were perfect for shooting. So I filled my obligations and shot away. Clocked in at 06:29 when the day starts at 06:30 so i just made it in. This afternoon the clouds were all fluffy so I shot some more on a lenghthy drive home. I was stuck on the concept of light poles and sharp angles. Took a few good ones. Today was a creative day. While at work I joked around with my pal Anthony all day and shot apicture of his ipod. The coolest picture was the bug parts and hair and crumbs from the inside of the break room fridge however.
