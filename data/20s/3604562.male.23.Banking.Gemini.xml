      Gaurav and I spoke with Mahesh Aras regarding the inner ring issue. Mahesh was very good and kind. They started on a defensive and settled for the lee instead of the truly aspirational (I think).

      There has been a frantic amount of action on the search engine front with Overture, Altavista,Alltheweb,Inktomi,Yahoo and others eating each other. Whither is Google in all this? And why?  Probably because it faces no threat and it has super algorithm capabilities backing its engines. There is no point buying a lousy search engine, obviously.

      Kissinger believed that the "market-China" supercedes all other arguments and Taiwan should eventually merge with China. TWN became a democracy in 2000 after years of autocratic rule....  Impact of politics and the position of China and US on the unification matter is  very  crucial. No matter what the deal.

      Sam is IBM_CEO after Gerstener and makes Lotus Sametime that I have been trying to use for sometime now. How he belives it's always 'client'and not 'customer' as the former brings lifetime revenues and not-off. More reading makes it seem as though the society is largely 'information based'.

      Some guys here are contemplating leaving and are quite convinced of the baseness of work that goes on here. I see their point buy believe that there is scope to impress the goodness upon people who matter.

      Google has 20.7 million stock options outstanding at an exercise price of US$5.21. The stock is expected to debut between US$108-135.  About 50% of the stocks are fully vested (check this..) So they can be instantly cashed&nbsp;

      Aware that India's Rs 22,500 crore retailing industry was galloping at an unbelievable pace (grew by 25 percent last year), Reliance had to go for it. Incidentally, there are estimated 4.3 million retail outlets, of which the organised sector accounts for less than 2 percent only!  Shall we say move over WalMart or J.C. Penney, here comes the Indian juggernaut: Reliance.Shopping malls and hyper malls and what not, all over the country, is what Reliance has up its sleeves, though the company is yet to reveal all.While the Indian consumer is just started releasing his money bags, very evident in the fact that malls and shopping plazas opening by the hour literally, catering not just to mid to high-end customers but also to the mass market, would be Reliance’s aim at providing consumers a complete shopping experience.  With retail petrol pumps, Reliance Infocom shops and now, hyper malls and super markets, the next one year will see the company fighting and biting in to the market share of the likes of Arvind Brands, Raymonds, Madura, S Kumar’s and others even as Walmart and their ilk plan launches in India, savoring on Indian consumers while treating them as Kings &amp; Queens.
