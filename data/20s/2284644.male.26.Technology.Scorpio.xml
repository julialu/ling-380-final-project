       urlLink Official Mary Prankster Website   A few years ago, using napster, i found out about a singer/songwriter from the Baltimore area name Mary Prankster.  Her music can best be described as cow punk, its a little country, a little punk, and a lot of foul mouthed swearing :)  Check it out, I recommend "Tits and Whiskey"

       urlLink    The digital cam pic is coming out kind of badly, so I fooled with it in photoshop to get rid of some of the glare.  This looks a little better....&nbsp; urlLink

      Today I lived office space.&nbsp; The corporate audit team came in and interviewed us one by one.&nbsp; I was the last to go in.&nbsp;  It sucked ass!&nbsp;  I get REALLY nervous when shit like this goes down.&nbsp; I talk really, fast, and start revealing information that I shouldn't reveal.&nbsp; They asked questions like, "How many hours do you work a week?".&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you ever work from home?"  &nbsp;Call me paranoid, but that shit makes me nervous.&nbsp;&nbsp; I think getting laid off does that to you.  I am forever scarred psychologically, yet I am only 26 years old.&nbsp;&nbsp;   In other news, maybe I will start looking for a new job.........

      The good Reverend Sharpton,  he is truly an unbelievable speaker.   Don't believe me?  Listen to this:        urlLink Al's  speech         Al rocked the democratic convention last night, in what was one of the best speeches so given so far. I truly hope he will join the Cabinet at some point in the future.    In other news, flies have invaded my home. We slayed no less than 234 house flies last night. Our personal discovery is that a vacuum cleaner makes a great execution tool for the little bastards.

        So my latest project at work has me writing code to  customize a huge software package IBM sells.   Everything is on a remote AIX  box, and is written in C++.   My brain is churning trying to remember the  easiest way to do this shite.   So far I am kicking cygwin on my xp laptop, and  using remote emacs to get to the files.  It feels strangely comfortable, like  reuiniting with an old girlfriend.

      I am a bad blogger, so I am going to try to catch up.&nbsp;&nbsp;   New news:  I now live in Austin Tx.&nbsp;&nbsp;  I can't wait until November to vote. I work for IBM again (since march) I am going to upload all of my paintings here, as well as other cool stuff I encounter along the way.  I found a listing in the austin chronicle about a vintage flea market on Sunday.&nbsp; I am oh so there.  &nbsp; quote of the day: It's not about being liberal, it is about recognizing the obvious.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;

      I am still working on the painting currently entitled Old Lady and child.  I am putting some lines on the fence, and it is kind of a bitch.  I tape areas, paint, then let it dry for 2 days before i can do it again.   Its slow going.  I found out today at work I have to go back to Germany twice in september.  I have tickets for a pixies concert in mid september, (seeing the pixies play is on my life to do list), of course,  manager man wants me to skip it.      HAHAHAHAA i say.  Not a chance, sucker.   So now I will be flying back to texas to see the show, then getting back on a plane (20 hour travel day) to go back to work.  You know what? It's worth it. Some things you just have to stand your ground on.

      The alarm on my cell phone went off at the oh so early hour of 6:15.  I awoke from my NyQuil induced slumber to realize I had to go to work.    What a jip.  The weekend was quite calm.  Since we have white trash tendencies, our house was a wreck.  Let me explain.   We have this huge dining room area (see the pics from the earlier post).  Now, since white trash boys don't like investing in things like tables and chairs, my brother chose to use the dining room as a workshop to build a speaker box.   3 days later, it was filled with lumber, sawdust, tools, and blood.  Oh yeah, he cut his pretty bad.  Then he passed out and bled on the floor.  What a puss.  Anyways, The house is now immaculate for at least a day.  Much like the terror alert scale our dictator uses, I will make one for my house.   We are currently at orange alert, which means a full scale mess is a possibility.  I saw an indy film this weekend called the station agent.  Probably the best movie I have seen this year.  Its a must see.  PS  I get to go see the Pixies in September.  Top that, chief.
