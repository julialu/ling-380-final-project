He has more shots of the Dynamic Earth mine tour (which Stok scoffed at, because it's not a  real  mine like the gold mine tour in his native Timmins).

       urlLink    We made a grisly discovery: a bin full of human organs.    This was actually pretty neat.  The bib had embroidered outlines and Velcro on it, and so you were supposed to stick the organs in the appropriate places.  It even had a place for kidneys on the back.  There was also a brain, but we couldn't figure out where it went (i.e. there was no matching hat to which to adhere it).    The plan at Science North is to eventually move the special exhibit "Human Machines" to this level with the rest of the human body stuff.  Thanks to "Human Machines", I now know that my small intestine is 617 cm long.  That's a lot of intestine.

       urlLink    Quillan the porcupine, Wednesday morning.    He was rocking back and forth on his hind feet by the gate of his pen, hoping to be let out for a walk.  He also smelled quite a bit.  Apparently porcupines communicate through scent as their sight is quite bad.
