      It seems that because I had another window open to post blogs in, and a browser open to see the blog that had been published,my entries are coming below the ones posted before them! Aaah. Oh well. Let's see if this works now. (15:13 EST)

      I'm trying to connect to the world. MSN sucks. Pass me the eggplants...YUM!
     
    


16,April,2004


     
      Heh, so Finally me and my buds perfected the art of placing the coals on the sheesha correctly. Last night, after smoking 2 heads of rose tobacco at stars, the fact that nicotine is a pyschoactive chemical became quite apparent. Talk about a buzz. 8-}

      Sorry Zuni, but eggplant is finished! Here's my recipe for it though - just 'cos I'm bored and I'm a show-off :P  Sour Eggplant/ Khattay Baingan  8 baby eggplants, cut into quarters 1 small onion, finely diced 2 spring onions, finally sliced 1/2 small green pepper (shimla mirch), finely diced 1/2 cup pureed tomatoes (or fry 3/4 cup crushed fresh tomatoes in a little oil into a paste and reduce it) 1 tsp crushed garlic (or 1 clove minced) 1/2 tsp black onion seeds (kalonji) 1 tsp cumin seeds (zeera) 1/2 tsp tumeric (haldi) 1 tsp red chilli powder (or to taste) Salt (to taste) 4-6 tbsp Oil green chillis, chopped small bunch coriander leaves (dhania), chopped  Fry the onion, spring onion, kalonji and zeera in medium-hot oil until pink and translucent. Add the pepper and garlic, fry for a minute and add the eggplant. Stir to mix and add the spices and seasoning. Fry for a few minutes and then add the tomatoes and bring to a boil (or until it bubbles, which will be soon!). Reduce heat to minimum, cover and cook. Garnish with chopped green chillis and coriander. Serve hot or cold... Yum!

And why can't I know when my favorite Naseeber updates his or her blog? Or leaves a note at the end? And why can't I ping my friends online like I used to? I'm such a cry baby!

Yes, yes, I saw. ColdSkin has a nice take on the defination of "Life". I say, life is like a box of chocolates. Umm, what? Oh you are right. I didn't say that. Forrest did. Now that was a movie.

        Life   n. pl. lives (lvz)    The property or quality that distinguishes living organisms from dead organisms and inanimate matter, manifested in functions such as metabolism, growth, reproduction, and response to stimuli or adaptation to the environment originating from within the organism.    Man, these guys can define anything but I think it's a crime to define it in such cold manner! If I had my say nowadays then this is how I shell define it:   Life     A finite journey through a wobbly thin rope. The trick is in the balance with little room for error. One wrong step and we all fall down!     death    ( P )  Pronunciation Key  (dth)  n.  The act of dying; termination of life.  The state of being dead.  The cause of dying: Drugs were the death of him.  A manner of dying: a heroine's death.  often Death A personification of the destroyer of life, usually represented as a skeleton holding a scythe.  Bloodshed; murder.  Execution.  Law. Civil death.  The termination or extinction of something: the death of imperialism.    bla bla bla....I know death is dark but it can be defined!   Death      The Fall; The wrong step taken on the wobbly rope of life; Loss of Balance

      Bitch. Bitch. Bitch. Bitch.  House hunting is a bitch.  Locking horns with your father who wants to live 55 kms away from downtown is a bitch.  Having your life, languages, loves and *men* centred in downtown (thus) is a bitch. Hmm. Mebbe not. Arzee's in Mississauga ;)  Being unemployed is a bitch.  Being physically exhausted and mentally drained is a bitch.  Typing when your fingers are fibrillating from exhaustion is a bitch.  Sleeping at 2am knowing you've got to be up in less than 8 hrs is a bitch.  Life's a bitch. You never know which orifice you're going to be fucked in next.  That's all for tonight folks. Peace out.

      Gmail might seem awesome at first but I will not use it as my primary email address if I were you. There is a current controversy going on because google plan to scan your emails and then according to that you will have the appropriate ads on the sides of the browser. For example matching words in your email related to electronic, male enhancement: p, etc.   Good for using it as an online briefcase though.

      I just friggin tried sending an email to a Naseeber and this is what it coughed back at me:  "! For your own protection, you may not post your personal email address, lastname, or instant messenger id on Naseeb. Doing so can damage your trusted circle by allowing people you don't really know to contact your friends and their friends. Violation of this policy will result in the termination of your account."   The only thing friggin close to an email address in my message was the use of the word 'MSN messenger'!! Argh! What the FUCK is up with Naseeb?  I've already posted my email address and last name to 3 people through the Naseeb mailbox earlier. Will Naseeb pay me a refund for allowing that? Hmph!

      You won't believe the gunk under my laptop's keys. Hair, chips, food splotches, dust, dust mites (so what if I can't see them? They exist!), more dust, even more dust, trails of dust like lint, a bit of a nail (the finger kind).. Ew. I am so grossed out by my own laptop. Now I know what three years of grime looks like. It was a used laptop so I wonder if the guy who owned it ever cleaned it in the two years he had had it. Makes you think....  My MANY thanks to my baasht fraand MT who not only patiently cleaned the gunk under my laptop but also backed up all my data and is now reformatting my system and fixing it all up, as good as new! So whilst I type this in his tres coowal office in west end Toronto, I sigh at his 19 inch flat screen monitor and go "If only.....".

      I like this template. I've used this one for several I've help create. Please stick to it for at least two weeks since I'd rather this blog doesn't transform into a music video...and I like ma friggin MTV!!!   Indy: I second and third and fourth you! No censor shit from Naseeb. Zia was shot down. PTV is doomed for life. Why must Naseeb become another relic from the censorship era?? As far as I'm concerned, there are no KIDS on Naseeb. WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO PROHIBIT NEXT NASEEB? Let us mind our own words and deeds here PALEEZ.   Everyone blogs when I'm at work. No fun :P 
     
    


19,April,2004


     
      I really feel like saying this right about now: "We dont censor shit!"
     
    


19,April,2004


     
      6:17 AM and I am still up. I did what I did yesterday, the day before and the day before that and again the day before that day....I am out!
     
    


19,April,2004


     
      It's so difficult to make please every one...isnt it? MT wants a red template but IndyW likes this white one. I think I hear some one yelling: "Custome Skin!!" :p
     
    


19,April,2004


     
      Hey CS! What's up with this crappy skin? I liked the red one better. Everything looked organized. This one sucks man. Oh, and 3-4 of your links are mistyped. You entered http:// like twice. Fix it. :p
     
    


18,April,2004


     
      FRIGGIN' NASEEB. COLDY! I can't add you to my circle. It does not accept alien_contact()h0tmail.c0m email address. What now Skinny?

18,April,2004


     
      This is what happens when you create without sleep, IndyW :p.  On a different note, I totally agree with you on naseeb's censorship policies, they suck! No body tells me what I can and can't write in my own email, journal or message! 
     
    


18,April,2004


     
      And I just realised what else was making my eye twitch at reading the heading of this blogspot. It's the word "adobe". Damnit Zee, the word is "abode"! (which means home).. unless you wanted to take the piss out of Adobe (acrobat reader? photoshop?) people...which I don't think you wanted to do. Aagh. Change the typo!  Sorry, I'm just a bit stressed about the Naseeb censorship and the impending doom tomorrow morning for which I have not gotten round to preparing as much as I should have. Agh. Back to the drawing board for me.

      I'm pissed off. Left this comment on my own article covering Monis.  "I've been a big fan and supporter of Naseeb since its inception last year. I have supported the work of the Naseeb team, the fact that it needs to charge (how else will it run as a business?) and given as much feedback as possible to make sure that the users voices are being heard. With all due respect, my love for Naseeb aside, I have a huge complaint. And that is that I can't publish any email address - on either my journal or my personal emails to my friends on Naseeb. Excuse me? Hello? I am not violating anyone's privacy by promoting my fledgling theatre company in my journals. I am not stupid enough to leak my personal email address to anyone on Naseeb. If I do so, I deserve to be hacked. And finally, my real annoyance at this point is with the word "hot mail" or "yah oo". I can't even use the word "yah oo" or any variation of it, in expressing my joy at being published, because a huge company by the same name hosts email addresses! Dang it, I've got to use a SPACE between the word to break it up. That is absolutely WRONG and amounts to EXTREME censorship. If people flag up profiles by all means censor them. But if I can't even use the word "yah oo" then I'm beginning to have issues with Naseeb's censorship policies."  I wonder if I'll still remain in his good books as featured author. After all, do we have a right to rebel against the rules set by the Naseeb administrators? We shall wait and see. I wonder if my sarcasm is scathing enough but also shows my love for this site. Only time will tell. *foreboding sense of gloom*  Oh, btw, welcome Winston! Hope you're good Cap'n.

      Whoa dude, Good one. I found out how to remove testimonials from anyone's profile :P and how to view request only picutures :P. We should make a list of this stuff
     
    


18,April,2004


     
       New glitch I discovered on naseeb:  if you even type the name hotmail or yahoo, it will not allow you to send that message....kkhee-he-he-he. To beat the system just substitute Os with Zeros and @ with ()for example: alien_contact()h0tmail.c0m ;)

      yo! I'm like the only person besides my sis and zuni who like Naseeb. Everyone else seems to be bitching about the interfact. I just think it's cos their simple brains cannot take the information overload. And desis.. always trying to get everything for free!

       Love the new Naseeb frontpage. And Naseeb Vibes looks like it wants to kick-ass.    Note Indy writer puts Monis in the hot seat...hii-ya!  First impressions...more later!

18,April,2004


     
      Okay - you need to change the background IMMEDIATELY to all black because it's confusing the shit out of me. And "posted by" is better than "brain sneezed out on". That looks dumb! Keep the skull on the side though.

      Indeed. I'm unemployed too y'know. All us brill people, jobless. Heart wrenching really. But once we start work it's a never ending grind so like..whatever. This template lacks warmth but it's more readable. Maybe reduce the font 1 size, and "bold" the nickname, so that you can distinguish between entries more easily? Why you up kiddo?;)
     
    


18,April,2004


     
      Broke? Indy did you call out for me? lol    anywayz, how do you like this template?!

      *yawn* the HotDocs festival is on starting next week in Toronto! North America's biggest documentaries festival..sounds YUM. I've been shortlisting my movies.. the only hassle? Father. Hmm. You can watch the docs free @ 11PM every night. I think I'll go on Apr 23 and queue at 7am to make sure that I get those advanced tickets. If not, maybe I'll buy a 10 film pass for $60 and go :P Or mebbe buy single tickets... Hate being broke :@

      Indy: This is just one of five default templates that I chose. Once I get a hang of this I will be changing a lot of parameters, there are a lot of custome stuff you can do. Of course, this all depends on how well this takes off though.

      'mornin kids. I haven't slept yet. Been busy ;) Had to make sure that ColdSkin got my red carpet rolled out, my cherry champagne ready with a cherry on cocktail stick. "cocktail stick" - mighty straaange word...cock + tail + stick... Hmm. The image is unflattering and I'm tired @ 05:18am here in To'. Just dropped off my ward @ 4am. *yawn*..Zee, is there any way that everytime someone blogs it shows up in a different color? I hate this interface, keep getting confused and have to check a gazillion times to see where a particular comment began :/

      I get a funny feeling, it comes from deep inside. I get all mad and angry, wanting to go and hide.  My doctor calls it depression, my friends says it's just me. But the thoughts and feelings, no one will ever be able to see.  Some say I'm psycho, some say I'm just weird. It's like I'm a different person, and the old me just disappeared.  I get really edgy, I want to do something real bad. Then I get a headache, followed by feeling sad.  I wish I could get help, I wish it would go away. Maybe if I keep praying real hard, it will some day.

      On the contrary, my dearZuni Spin-a-rooni! It's you who shell lose your peace, I have know to drive people to the edge. BTW, who's talking about watching playboy on the computer? This is US of A, lady...the sin state!

      The substance's long worn off...Sunday morning sunlight scorching ma eyes. And Naseeb is a pain when its slow!     Quick comment : Are all 97000 members on Naseeb active IDs?  Like Hotmail, profiles that do not update/check-in for  1 month  or  90 days  should be deactivated.  Unless Monis is simply interested in showing off these figures to his VCs?  How come all new IDs are funny and creative these days?

       From Zuni: Wonder what Zee is mixing!!   Girl, I aint fixin' shit!! Nowadays I am making people fix me good shit!! ;)    'I'm on a high, on a high...' and it has nothing to do with Naseeb :P   OOookay, easy on that substance girl..you'd want to save some for my trip to Karachi :p

      OK I am back..been out the whole day, LONG DAMN DAY!   Let me start with a  shout out  and a  WELCOME  to every one (especially Indy) with a red carpet and for pointing out my typo ;)   Like I said it's been a long damn day. Farya (fiancée'), Aliya, Bilal and Me had volunteered for the International Festival at Reliant Arena. Was busy there till 7:00 pm. Then met up with my car club one last time before I left and also had to sell some car accessories to my peeps to earn some $$$! From there we all went to see Kill Bill Vol. 2, just getting home right now 1:15AM. Opps not really, just leaving for another friends to drown my sorrows in the psycadalic smoke of a Sheesha.   I SHELL RETURN!!

      I found another form of heartbreak today. Having a close 'friend' betray you.

      My fairwell party just got over. Did as much cleaning up as I could, it's time to just fall and sleep...am damn too tired.
     
    


29,April,2004


     
      Zuni: Okay?! What actually happened that made you say this?
     
    


28,April,2004


     
      Not everything in life should be taken seriously. Specially, Naseeb.
     
    


27,April,2004


     
      or if you wanna see a really good movie then go watch:  " urlLink Sex & Car Crashes "  also knows as  Crash  but be ready to puke your gutts out!! Starring David Spade and Holly Hunter. Oh dont you forget to watch   urlLink Caligula   starring Malcolm McDowell.

      Unless Junoon were singing any of their old stuff, I dont want to hear about them!!  Hey Zee: how's the fever?? You know you can't really go home looking all FLU-ee. Get some strong antibiotics, Tylenol rocks! Ahem, Im sure you are being comforted anyways :~)  My new entry on Taboo is not getting the response I'd expected from people. There MUST be some subjects you all consider a Taboo in Pakistan or India? Come on, lets hear it!!

      (waves hello to all). I have been logged out of Naseeb for some unknown, inadvertent sin I've committed. If I cannot get back in, I shall NOT pay and become another 'Premium'. Just wanted to tell you ~~IW loved that journal on Intellectual Isolation! Five stars!

03,May,2004


     
      The lady at www.goingpolar.com is really something. We need more Muslim women to do such things more often to clear up the western cliché’ on women oppression in the Muslim countries. I have nothing but respect for her....I wish her good luck in her endeavor and will pray for a smooth journey, God's speed Anoushka.   Beside, SHE IS HOT!! :p

I mean, start spreading some $$$ to get our votes...ahem..I know...I SHOULD be voting for your freeee. Okay. Will do! :P (Man, today, I'm just going from bad to pathetic to..what's next?) Hee, me your Muni too, Indy? Don't spoil me. You know its the other way round LOL!  Satya: Did you finally get in? I'm sure it was a Naseeb screw up. You can't really be blocked out? right? RIGHT?!  And last but not the least: I DEMAND TO BE VOTED INSANELY APPEALING BECAUSE I CREATED THAT CATEGORY. Yelled loud enuff for yer lovely, dovely earrrs, Naseebers?!! VOTE ZUNI, VOTE ZUNI, VOTE ZUNI!!

      Ya, I'm beginning to find how effective words can be. With all this stuff out there on the Abu Ghraib prison scandal, we now have another problem...Propaganda. Both sides are gulity of this. There have been pictures of rape from Abu Ghraib, posted on american newspapers, that were given to them by the Nation of Islam, that turned out to be from a S&M porn site. At this point all I can say is...the shit is about to hit the jet turbine.  I would write about the idea of strategic assasinations and propaganda,  but if i end up acting on my own work, then I wouldnt want any record of it :P   I could write about the Propaganda, but I dunno if anyone would care to read it.  What do yall think? Should I write about it?  --Amir

      Salams Kiddos.. Here's the time to show your true colors and support for fellow Naseeb bitchers! So, off you go to: http://oxigen.f2o.org/naseeb/index.php and vote for me for the usual categories - best journal, best commentator, best bla bla.. uknow ;)   I don't believe I actually thought this was a bad idea to begin with and now.. Power.. fame.. terrible things.. *Brutus-esque SIGH*..lol..   Anyway, so I watched this ADORABLE Spanish film called 'Valentin' which is set in the 1960s in Buenos Aires. Valentin is a 8 yr old with divorced parents who lives with his grandmother and dreams of becoming an astronaut. Such a sensitive film.. loved it. Please go watch it!

      Hey all! I am back.. Sorry I've been ignoring you for the past week. Just catching up with things. No one seems to have bothered to read my (old, but) newly published (on Naseeb) piece about cross border shaadis being (an aid) to the long term IndoPak problems. Except for Amir, who is my lil protege. Mark my words, this one will make his mark!  Thanks Satya for your acquiescence. It is good to find similar minded folk who think intellectual isolation is, in one short phrase, self-induced bollocks! :P~  Where are the rest of you? Muni.. BZ better not think he's got the copyright to Muni since we've been calling you ZuniMuni for as long as I can remember...

      All quite here? Anything fun on Naseeb these days? Any new and notables on Vibes? I can't remember the last time I clicked on anything but the journals I usually visit.   I was thinking, Naseeb should enable us updating our JE's through our mobile phones. Future fiction what say you all?

        NEWS UPDATE :  Z&Z (Zuni &amp; Zee) were spotted at Duncan Donuts in Karachi’s defense area around 2:05 pm on the afternoon of&nbsp;26th of July.&nbsp;They met up, had a laugh, had coffee,&nbsp;enjoyed each others company and secretly&nbsp;left around 2:55 pm. Sources close to them said Zuni was really stessed-out as she&nbsp;had a stuck-up MIT professor to interview (who kept putting it off)&nbsp;where as Zeeshan had to shop at THE FORUM. Zuni also presented Zee with a secret document (Spider Mag:&nbsp;Paks&nbsp;IT Mag)&nbsp;containing publication of Zee's work (one of his poems).   Till their next meet, this is your reporter COLDSKIN signing off:    &nbsp;"....and this how the cookie crumbles!"  (Taken from Bruce All Mighty) :p
