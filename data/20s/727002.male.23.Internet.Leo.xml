See my silhouette throught the curtain, why I'm wearing a dress isn't certain, when I steal your dough you'll be hurting, from the stabbing in the shower, with the spicket on hot......

17,August,2002



       
      what the hell are you staring at?!?
     

    


15,August,2002



       
      well i am registered for classes, but they dont have my loan up on financial aid yet, so i can't confirm registration fin. aid. payment, and will probably end up getting purged from the system with my luck...
     

    


11,August,2002

04,August,2002



       
      i find i'm happiest through loving another...when i'm allowed to show someone how much i love them and make them happy, then i am truly happy...
     

    


01,August,2002



       
      What do I do to ignore them behind me? Do I follow my instincts blindly? Do I hide my pride from these bad dreams And give in to sad thoughts that are maddening? Do I sit here and try to stand it? Or do I try to catch them red-handed? Do I trust some and get fooled by phoniness, Or do I trust nobody and live in loneliness? Because I can't hold on when I'm stretched so thin I make the right moves but I'm lost within I put on my daily faï¿½ade but then I just end up getting hurt again By myself (Myself)

      if i put the time it took me to take the IQ test into the form, rather than leaving it blank and letting it assume the full 13 minutes, my IQ jumps to 149
     

    


25,February,2003



       
      It is a far, far, better thing that I do, than I have ever done; it is a far, far, better rest that I go to, than I have ever known.

      is it a sign of weakness to walk in the door, and fall down in the middle of your bedroom floor, and just start crying?
     

    


21,February,2003



       
      let's be honest here... the whole thing would be like "hey! remember me? i'm that little kid you wanted abso-fucking-lutely nothing to do with!"
     

    


21,February,2003



       
      i also looked up the last name in people.yahoo.com, and had it draw a map...

      hmm... you haven't locked me up yet... what if i tell you i honestly believe she liked me best, but was just afraid of a relationship at the time? is that enuff to sound crazy yet?
     

    


20,February,2003



       
      okay, maybe i'm very obsessed... to be spending all my free thoughts on someone i haven't seen in years... that's just plain committable... lock me up and throw away the key
     

    


20,February,2003



       
      i'm a bit obsessed...you know, i still know her old license plate number =\

16,February,2003



       
      thoughts of her, my hating myself, all of these are just phases...and all of them pass...everything in my life is just a phase...and they all end
     

    


16,February,2003



       
      "...you are afraid of losing someone dear to you." - not that there's anyone dear to me anywhere close to me, i already lost them when they left me...

15,February,2003



       
      also on the topic of dreams...had a bit of lucid earlier today right after work...i realized it was a dream when i started losing my teeth again...that happens so often in my dreams...not rotting or anything, just like when a tooth comes loose when you're a child, but i usually lose 2 or 3 or more in a dream...of which i've read in some meanings could be: "...you are afraid of losing someone dear to you." anyway, when i tried to take over the dream, i just ended up waking...
     

    


15,February,2003



       
      about the dream...while it had the usual "this is a dream, so everything is fucked up" aspects...it had me desperately vying for her attention...that part was pretty damn accurate
     

    


15,February,2003



       
      it is fitting that last nite i dreamt of her again...

      still thinking...
     

    


26,March,2003



       
      there was another dream... but i guess really it was just a cameo appearance

      how do i know that you're all not just figments of my imagination? that i'm the only one that's real? because i'm just not that damn creative...the comics i read, the books, the tv shows i watch, the movies, the games i play, the people i know, i could never come up with all of them just to create a world around me...

       all i want is a chance with a love i've never known a love that's never left my heart no matter how far we are apart all i want is to know her for her to know i care to hold her in my arms to protect her from all harm  but all that i am still just a little boy full of fear full of emotion afraid of what he'll be if just given a chance  all i want is a cure to help clean up my life to cure the loneliness to clean up this mess all i want is an end a simple fucking end to this misery and strife to this simply fucked up life  but all that i am still just a little boy full of fear full of emotion afraid of what he'll be if just given a chance   - a chance

      i just read 3 Daredevil TPB's written by Brian Michael Bendis; Wake Up (DD Vol. 2 16-19),  Underboss (V2 26-31), and Out (V2 32-40)...how the fuck have i not been reading DD Vol.2 all this time? i mean, i love courtroom drama and i love vigilante justice, DD has both...oh well...i'm reading it now from issues 41-45, and we just ended the latest arc: Lowlife... now i need to get the other 2 TPBs, while not Bendis (Daredevil Visionaries: Kevin Smith (V2 1-8) is (surprisingly) Kevin Smith, and Parts of a Hole (V2 9-15) is David Mack) should hopefully still be a good enuff read...

      and then there's the realist in me... i know it would never work, i haven't even seen her in years... or spoken in over a year... if she's changed, i don't even know her anymore... if she hasn't changed, well, did i ever really know her? then there's the question that really irks me, why? why would i choose to fixate myself on her... is she the proverbial "one that got away"? is that why i'm doing this? or is it something more like a chemical inbalance that i'm choosing not to treat...

      i believe there are two sides to me... the hopeless romantic, and the cynical bastard... i believe there are more things in this earth than we can understand, and i believe in destiny... but i also believe in choice... how can there be destiny and choice? wouldn't who we are control our choices? and yet, each choice would redefine who we are... i want to believe dreams have meaning, our actions are with reason... i dunno anymore...

      jeremy, you're an Observer!  That means you're one of the more kind-hearted people around. You are unusually intuitive, and you probably understand yourself, as well as others. That also means you're a good mediator ï¿½ though you may prefer to spend more quiet time on your own than most.  Because of the self-knowledge you already possess, you are better equipped than many to steer your life in the right direction. Understanding more about the components of your personality will reveal unique information that even people like you might not realize. And the better you know yourself, the more confident you'll be making decisions that affect your life.

      jeremy, the Right Job for you will allow you to be:  Creative and Analytical   You're a visionary in many people's eyes ï¿½ able to think outside of the box to come up with your own solutions. You're creative not necessarily in the artistic sense, but because you can expand your mind to do things differently from others.  It might take a while for colleagues to recognize and reward for your entrepreneurial spirit and abilities. That could be because they envy you, or because they find your ideas slightly rebellious ï¿½ willing to go against the current.  All in all, you make it hard for people to pigeon hole you. That is why you, more than others, need a job that allows you to play to your strengths, break out of the mold, and truly excel.

            You are Form 0,  Phoenix : The Eternal.  "And The Phoenix's cycle had reached zenith, so he consumed himself in fire.  He emerged from his own ashes, to be forever immortal."   Some examples of the Phoenix Form are Quetzalcoatl (Aztec), Shiva (Indian), and Ra-Atum (Egyptian). The Phoenix is associated with the concept of life, the number 0, and the element of fire. His sign is the eclipsed sun.  As a member of Form 0, you are a determined individual.  You tend to keep your sense ofoptomism, even through tough times and have a positive outlook on most situations.  You have a way of looking at going through life as a journey that you can constantly learn from. Phoenixes are the best friends to have because they cheer people up easily.   urlLink   Which Mythological Form Are You?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla

      now we will discuss a small film from some no-name director, Quentin Tarantino, called  Kill Bill Vol. I  let us first start off with yes the movie was cut into two volumes, and yes i agree the average movie goer will probably like it better in 2 halves. Myself however wanted more at the end. Not more as in a sequel 4 months down the road, but more as in NOW! Here's hoping Miramax puts off putting Volume 1 onto DVD until after Volume 2, so that they can be seen as 1 cut if so desired. The over-the-top violence, and bloodshed was perfect. This was his homage, if you will, to classic Western, Samurai, and Kung Fu movies. Each character on  The Bride 's list are their own genre of film. Tarantino's time-hopping style was worked in perfect here, from Chapter 1 to the end of the film (which happens before Chapter 1), and will even stretch into Volume 2 I'm sure. And guest appearances from legendary Sonny Chiba and Gordon Liu were approriate, and amazing. Now, the movie probably isn't for everybody. This is no  Pulp Fiction . This is a labor of love by the director to pay tribute to the films he grew up with, and if you aren't a fan (or atleast heard of) of say Shaw Brothers films, you may not like this. The violence is excessive, but IMO done with such style that it borders art. Any film connoisseur though should rightly love this. I sure as hell did.

      so, i've been playing  Knights of the Old Republic  getting to choose dark things is fun, "YOU KNOW TOO MUCH! YOU MUST DIE!" seriously tho, why Lucasarts keeps shoving the trilogy based game shit down our throats is ridiculous, the Expanded Universe has so much more, and this game has sold so well maybe they'll notice and make more... i mean, they can't say EU games will fail anymore after seeing the numbers on a game set 4,000 years before the fall of the Republic. It doesn't get much more "expanded" than that... or does it?

      and tonight is a perfect end for a crappy week starting Sunday night my DSL kept dropping connection, and there was a lot of static on my phone... Thursday Sprint ran a new line and everything is now fine that day I had to stand outside with the Sprint guy, and ended up breaking out from Posion Ivy and such... today i went and bought some Benadryl and am using something called "Ivy Dry" so now my 120GB harddrive has went and died on me... i took my Benadryl, went to bed, and when i returned Windows was reporting that E: is not formatted, would you like to format it now? chkdsk is unable to repair it, but apparently the data is still there, will try to boot into  Knoppix  to see if i can copy some files over before having to re-format the drive i also am dogsitting a dog that despite being taken out, will come back in and avoid the "pee-pad" i've laid down altogether and go piss on my bedroom carpet (3 fucking times now)

Transformers Super Link - 02  and we've had the translated script for 03 since monday... but not edited/typeset/and such... with the translator hard at work on catching up... (if only i could say the same for the editor, a job i could easily do, and quicker)... today in Japan Super Link 09 aired (meaning we're 7 eps behind now), and tomorrow Energon (the domestic/dubbed Super Link) 06 airs... if they could just finish the scripts i'd have us caught up to the domestic atleast before next week airs 07... *sigh*  #AiA has been pretty dead for some time, i think the next  GaoGaiGar  is nearing completion soon though...

      also,  Kill Bill: The Whole Bloody Affair  will reportedly be shown at Cannes this year, that's right, Tarantino is showing a cut of Vol.1 and Vol. 2 together, or how it should've been in the first place (damn Miramax)... this bit of news holds much promise that the upcoming DVD set will indeed include a cut of the full movie, with all the bonus features Tarantino has spoken of... here's hoping, because Vol. 2 does stand up pretty well on its own IMO, however, a complete film could mean  film of the year  material to me =D

      so i was flipping through  Previews  (it's a monthly catalog for upcoming comics and other comic store merchandise), and see a solicit for  Kill Bill the Novel  written by Quentin Tarantino, which leaves me to wonder.. "does he write like he speaks?" if so, i believe it'd be something like this  Okay, see, The Bride drops her pregnancy test, alright? and like, she bends over, okay? so like then a big hole is shot through the door, okaaayy? And it's like 2 fucking inches above her, okay? Like she's only 2 inches below the shotgun blast, okaaay?! And see, like The Bride ducks for cover, alright, cus she's like THE BRIDE, okay, like she's THE mother fucking BRIDE! Like, SHE's the bitch you go to to get people killed, alright? So she's like behind the bed aiming her gun at the assassin, okay?! So like the assassin is there holding a shotgun at the Bridge, alright? So like The Bride says, "You any good with that thing?" okaay. and like the assassin goes "Not that i have to be at this range, but i'm a fucking surgeon." okay? cus like the shotgun can like blow The Bride away, like cus she's right in front of her, alright?  okay, in all seriousness, i'm sure he doesn't write like that, the scripts aren't like that... oh, and that's a scene from Volume 2, but it's been in clips, so i doubt anyone is spoiled... so bleh

         I am a mysterious dreamer.  As if the world was not already confusing, my subconcious is very deep.  Sometimes I wake up, heart beating fast, and I do not know what just happened.  I have a strong psychic sense and sometimes that can make it hard for me to actually 'get' the meaning of my dreams, they are very deep, and are strangely important.  I often find myself dwelling on them.    urlLink   What Sort of Dreamer Are You?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla

      so, i went to the comic store yesterday and got  Astonishing X-Men  #1, by Joss Whedon and John Cassady, and... OMG, this is the X-Men book I've been wanting. Lately I've started to drop the X-Men books from my subscriptions because I've just been finding better stories in other books (lately even venturing into DC with  Batman ,  Flash ,  Superman/Batman , and  Teen Titans ), but this book was just so frickin'  gooooooooood ... anyway, I decided I didn't want to get all 3 covers, and chose the variant that depicted the whole team. So guess what I discovered... the team variant is the incentive cover, it's going for upwards of $100 at other stores and on eBay!!! I PAID COVER PRICE WITH A 20% DISCOUNT OFF! LIKE $2! I'd go ahead and sell it now, but eBay is pretty floodied with them, will probably have to wait a week or two. I'll go back and get a regular cover to keep later.

      well, after the recent disappointment with  Masterforce 's imminent delay, i received a private message on The Allspark from a mr. Buster Darkwings. he's kind of (in)famous in the fandom, and has been trying to do real fansubs (e.g. on tape, not digital) for  Masterforce  for a couple years now. Anyway, let me cut to the chase, he's offering the scripts he's done so far, and to finish them for us to digi-sub, so that  Masterforce  could finally be available fansubbed. can i get a w00t? also, i should have the DVD-Rs for  Masterforce  early next week =P

      talked to mr. translator the other day, he is interested in doing  Masterforce , but not until after  Super Link  is finished, he's having a hard enough time keeping up there (duh? we're further behind than ever)... bottom line:  Masterforce  won't be around for atleast another 9 months (34 weeks of  SL  episodes remain) plus the time it takes to catch up...  why they felt they had to address me about my other post is beyond me, its the same things i've been bitching about to them for weeks... hence my "that was kind of stupid..."

      update!!! ran out of gas, so while its cooling down for refuel i come in to get a glass of tea and take some Benadryl (the allergenic horrors out there!), and while sitting at my pc i see blood drops on my shirt, look at my wrist rest and find a blood stain pooling... somehow i cut my wrist open!! sooo, the count so far is 4 band-aids (3 to cover the length of the burn, 1 on the wrist)  before the day is through i will have used my entire Neosporin tube and an entire box of band-aids, THIS I SWEAR!

      i was told to expect a script for 13 and 14 this weekend... well the weekend is over... =/ i hate my project staff... if the translator really wants to do  Masterforce  also he better get his ass in gear... when he "tried out" it only took him 2 days to give us a script, now its up to 2 weeks... if it was gonna be this long id've said "NO! YOU GO TO HELL!", alas... it's not fair... then there's the typesetter, that takes another week after i'm done editing, and she edits more and screws up stupid little things i then have to fix before encoding... not gonna be that way on  Masterforce  or  Victory  though, i'll be handling everything excepting timing and tranlsation on those... but i still need a punctual translator...

         You are most like Robin! A leader and fearless by nature, you tend to dive straight into something without thinking. You have a hard time trusting your friends sometimes and you are extremely serious when you have to. You don't like being compared to someone you are a rival with and sometimes your temper gets the best of you. Out of all of your friends you might be the one who dreams to be leader or is the leader. Whatever the reason sometimes you need to look before you leap.    urlLink   Which Teen Titans Character Are You?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla

      weeee... i got  Masterforce  03 back and re-timed fast... still waiting on the guy who's doing 02... still no  Super Link ... he's supposed to be given an ultimatum, failing that we may be going back to the original translator... he's timely, and i found his scripts much easier to work with too, so if i must go back to him, no complaints from me =P

      so  The Shield  season is over, and that means atleast 8 months till anything new (DVDs probably in January, hopefully Season 4 will start then too), I wouldn't mind a new comic if they get someone who might have actually seen an episode or two (the one that just finished was freaking horrible)... so anyway i hope to see some new licensing stuff (i'd love some action figures) otherwise it's going to be a long wait...  currently listening to  Daft Punk  -  Digital Love

      i may get in trouble for this post, oh well... so here's the dilly, i finally got  Super Link  13 (after 2 weeks) back from the typesetter to find she had gone through and changed several puncuation and capitalization and various other things despite my explicitly telling her not to worry about editing anyway (she's supposed to check the typeset (since i apply most of the styles now before it even gets to her) and check translation on a few lines for me), what's worse is after all her editing, she still missed several bad spellings and such (one that I even missed until after my first encode)... and i still haven't recieved 14 from her... as for 15+ from the Translator, well... i get to blame the typesetter again! He apparently had thought since 13 and 14 still weren't out yet after 2 weeks then we must've taken a small summer break, and i guess he didn't want to create a backlog of scripts for me... on to  Masterforce , the aforemetioned typesetter threw a fit because I didn't use her on the project (this while i was still waiting on 13 and 14 from her), also all of WPP were upset that i wasn't trying to release a 175MB version. So i had to re-encode at 175 to show them how that looks (and that was a chore too, more on that later)... anyway, there is quality loss, too much to justify 58MB smaller, so nyah... NOW, amidst all this, my PC kept hard locking while i was encoding... turns out my 120GB HDD is failing on me, so i've got an Advance RMA coming from Maxtor and hopefully should receive that Monday or Tuesday... My connection at work has been complete ass lately, a little over a week ago they moved all systems over onto a back up power system... since then anytime i send a file on IRC, it'll go for awhile, and then drop. not just drop, my IRC connection will reset, all webpages fail to load, etc. I'm on the same segment as our monitoring station, and it times out on all pings when this happens... apparently one switch had already gone bad, but they havent nailed down where this problem is, but apparently its not just me having problems with it... i have atleast one more night of it though because the sysadmin wont get to looking at it again till Monday day (i work Monday morning 00:00-08:00) so that's all my computer related problems... want to hear the personal ones?

       RARGH!  so i'm afraid to change anything in this script because this guy seems to get very upset when things aren't exactly like he did it... now he puts in an abbreviation ("Jr" instead of "Junior"), anyway I left it as "Jr" because that's what he had in the script, and that's what was on the title card anyway... so this is what i get:  Hrm, there were a couple of changes made to my script...  I guess I can live with the subs saying "Headmaster Jr" instead of "Headmaster Junior", even though I believe abbreviations shouldn't be used in subtitles since they reflect a person's speech...   WHAT!?!?!?!?  YOU'RE THE ONE WHO PUT IT IN THERE! Okay, so then there's this character who uses the words "mama" and "papa", the actual english words. He had them in subs as "mother" and "father" (respectively), but he also used "father" for words like "otousan" and "chichi". sooo seeing that she clearly says "papa", i changed those, also to note the difference in her word choice, and get:  And then keeping the katakana "mama" and "papa" untranslated kinda grates on me since I never hear anyone over 5 use those words in English..  yet she uses those EXACT WORDS in the episode... yes, i changed those (and with good reason), but the first part I left as it was in fear that changing it would solicit such a response from him... that's the irony, he complained about something I didn't change... he didn't even do this in private with me, but on our fricking public board...

      since i've been withdrawn lately, here's more TF updates instead...

Masterforce  02-03 are getting finishing touches done to the script... hopefully to be encoded sometime this weekend or so (yes, 01 still hasn't been released, it's been sitting at the distro peeps for almost a month now, *sigh*)

Masterforce 07 in distro, release any day... 08 was encoded today for QC and distro, 09-10 i have scripts and need to finish them...  had another dream earlier today, it was a very good one...  going to take some time off of work in a couple weeks... i COULD do something, but will probably lounge around the house, maybe get some cleaning done or something...

      well, i found out why the last couple days my connection has seemed slower, and i could only send files at 15K/s tops... apparently someone at Sprint noticed that they had uncapped by line speed and have since fixed it back to 576/160 kbps now add to the fact i can no longer plug in outside the firewall at work without the connection dropping every minute or so (you'd think they would've fixed that by now, but nooooooooo) means i can't send files to people at all (or atleast at a decent speed from here)... makes fansubbing work a little harder... will have to rely on BT from behind the firewall and such... maybe if i switch to an actual XTN provided circuit i can get uncapped speed at home (i've heard it mentioned) at the lowest rate's price... but still, this shit with my work connection should've been fixed months ago...
