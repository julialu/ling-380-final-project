       On a burst of caffiene, I am beginning another attempt to discipline myself as a writer.&nbsp; This blog will be a random, casual collection of my meanderings on the world.&nbsp; I suspect much of this may be inspired from interesting bits off NPR.&nbsp; I suspect some may be recordings of my sensory experiences.&nbsp; The goal is to make record of those thoughts, without filters, and have them available&nbsp;for later.&nbsp; Later, as in when I'll be doing something more structured.&nbsp; A small step.&nbsp; Towards structure.  &nbsp;

       Day 1  was strange.  All day long, while working at the Zumbro Cafe, I would catch myself unconsciously about to eat: a snitch of crisp as I made a dessert, a bite of a communal muffin, a taste of the chef’s new vegetable chowder.  Each time, I would catch myself mid-intention, and then stop.  It was amazing how many times I could have a bite of this or that in one day and how hard I had to focus to not to.  Day 2  was harder.  My head hurt that morning, badly, like a caffeine headache.  Which I only get while drinking coffee regularly.  Which I don’t, just for that reason.  I am very sensitive to caffeine addiction, so if I need a little boost, I drink black tea instead.  Today, the urge was strong, so I opted instead for espresso.  Since I couldn’t have a latte (milk -

       I've slithered into the clutches of pop culture.  After studying last month's  O  magazine, which reviewed several diet books and featured inspiring stories of women who "lost weight and  kept it off,"  I decided to do the one thing I never thought I'd do. I was going on a diet.  Diet. I hate that word. It brings to mind images of overweight women drinking Crystal Light while slathering more mayonnaise on white bread sandwiches.  People who diet are trying to fix something else in their lives and are seriously misdirecting their engergies.   I was only partially wrong about that.  Here's the self-conscious, self-defense bit: I eat well for the most part. Fast food, as a rule, repulses and irritates me. (And not just because wrappers from the McDonalds down the street accumulate daily in my driveway; it also runs right through me.) Anything pre-packaged, high fructose corn syrup-processed, I generally avoid. Too much soda makes my teeth feel like they're about to come loose and chip away. I shop co-op, buying mostly organic meats and produce. I eat breakfast. I've come to love fresh fish. I notice that potatoes make me feel heavy and tired, while oatmeal and whole grain bread happily sustain me til mid-afternoon.  And yet, in the six years since high school, I've accumulated a good 20 pounds. In my hips, my stomach, my love-handle region. Like most changes, the weight attached itself gradually, so it didn't bother me much. Once upon a time I wore a size six, then a comfortable eight, then a ten, and now, only a ten in certain labels. I only buy those labels.  In the last few years, my father was diagnosed with the ever-burgeoning, adult early-onset type II diabetes. Mid-way through her first pregnancy, my sister developed gestational diabetes. In her seventies, my mother's mother has developed diabetes, and one of my aunts had gestational as well. I feel like I'm marked.  Over winter break, between semesters, I would add a little weight, and not just because of holiday eating. I no longer had the three, four, five daily 15-minute walks between classes, or from the bus stop and home. Instead, I had more time to sit on my ass and "catch-up" on the TV I never got to watch. I could've walked the dog, sure, but it was way too cold for that.  As I graduated this past spring, I worried that I would again start putting on weight. So this summer I've started riding my bike again, making sure to do that, or take a long walk, three times a week.  While I haven't put on any more weight since May, I haven't been taking it off either. And I know I didn't mistakenly put my swimsuit in the dryer since last year. So I've gone and done what it seems everyone else is doing these days. I bought The South Beach Diet book, and stocked up on meat and vegetables and sugar-free Fudgsicles.  I have jumped on the carby-jargoney bandwagon.
