      Today the first thing my dog did was run out of the yard which has a locked iron gate and darted out onto a very busy street WONDERFUL! if she got hit by a car id would of been kicking the shit out of her crushed little corps as i scooped her onto a shovel. She's barely hanging on man and then tonight she deciced that she was a little munchie so so snaked on my wife's bra . the straps are nowhere to be found . I dont know what to do with her that little bitch . anyway we barbecued and ate meat good times had a water fight and came inside and sweated it out some more i hate the summer . I've been eating lots of water melon and has just realized that the reason i have to use the bathroom every half hour is the goddamn water melon! Stupid me .im off to use the bathroom.
