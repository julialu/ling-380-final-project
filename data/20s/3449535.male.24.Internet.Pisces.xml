       How I decided to go in Ireland ? Destiny has choosen for me. I have met Anne-Lise, back to France for few days and living in Dublin since 2 years. We have strated a great relationship together, for shure ... She said that the place where she's living was great, that's true ! and I encourage people to go overthere! It's so amazing, a total different way of thinking. You have to see to know...    It was my first time in Ireland. Basicly, I decided to go in Ireland to visit my girlfriend Anne-Lise in Dublin. The trip was a bit short (10 days) to visit everythings in Ireland but certainly one of my favourite trip. It represents a kind of a big turn in my life... This Trip was the best way for me to open my mind, to meet some intressing people, some strange people, some "different ways of thinking" and all the real "elements". Ok... If you want some names ... Guiness, Green stuff, lambs, stones, huge landscapes, outside front of the pubs' amiances, helpfull people, bed and breakfast, grass, weather (I know, pretty strange but I love the weater, not so hot, not so cold, strange and attractive luminosity ).
