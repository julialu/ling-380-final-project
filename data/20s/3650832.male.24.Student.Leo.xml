      Both this and the previous post were started with the best of intentions. The first was meant to work on the origins of good and the following post was intended to illustrate good's inherent evil by its connection with greed. Hopefully, both essays will be returned toin the near future so that they may be given the proper treatmetnts they deserve. Thank you for your patience, -the mgnt.  Are there any good that we cannot directly correlate to personal benefit? It seems that any of the goods we recognize, there is a positive consequence attached, whether immediate or delayed. Gratification and pleasure are goodness in their purest form as they are an end in themselves and cause these positive effects on the experiencer. All these pleasures, however, can only serve to wet the appetite for future, more intense goods. Aristotle accidentally set the groundwork for this when he mentioned, “of goods the greater is always more desirable” (134-35). This is a perfect example of the greed inherent in mankind. The desire to acquire more and more happiness forbids him to be happy with what he’s got. Why can’t we just shut up and appreciate what we’ve lucked into rather than bitching and endlessly scrambling for any personal advantage we can scrounge out of the earth or from another person? Happiness isn’t happiness. Happiness is a wolf in sheep’s clothing. Its only purpose is to bring the final, ultimate end, the void, nothingness, which is the only true happiness. All things we ascribe happy traits to are only paltry imitations of what will be later, but since we won’t make it that far, we think what we have is good. My oh my, much farther on this rant and we shall both be lost and annoyed, to pissy to carry on. One more round are we shall be ready to start again.

      That ineffable sense, that hazy notion, has laid itself in my lap in a way that is never to be expected (Which, I promise, is the best way to be overcome by the ineffable.). There is only one other person in this wide, woolly and wholly indispensable world who has any idea what the hell I’m talking about. She knows who she is, you, however, may not (which matters not in the least). There are moments that arrive from that untouchable nominal realm which knock (Yes, this is a reference to opportunity’s ragged cliché.) in such a surreal way that the heart is enticed to whole-heartedly throw open the rusted bolt and open the door so as to  graciously smile at that girl on the other side of the threshold. There she stands, in much the same garb (This reference is not wholly a physical reference, perhaps you both are encumbered in similar emotional apparel.) as yourself, perhaps slightly squirming in her shoes the same way you do in yours, with a smile rivaling the smile she induces on you.  There are walks and talks under moonlight that both parties had long ago relegated to those fantasies that the mind tells the heart will never occur (Is this sentence constructed correctly? Does it impose the intended impact? Does it conjure the desired the sense? Please let me know). Under the dipping stars (Only two people [I am one of them] smile at this image in the most honest way.) hands are held in a way that is truer than hands have even been held while ladies walk sideways (Once again, a reference for only the two.) While the world may not love a lover, the lover loves their love.

      Dear Plato, Did Socrates have to so dick-ish? As a literary device it doesn't work that well. (Yeah, I could run it around in the head for a while and find some b.s. thinking man's extrapolated jargon filled meandering, but even that seems a bit weak.) As a real person, he only affirms the greatness of the ancient Greek civilization being that no one socked him once or twice, at least not until high tea. Anyways, more later. Take care, Josh.

      Dear Art,  So, this “happiness”, from the sun and the pretty girls and these oh-so-enticing cigarettes and the world itself seemingly cheering me on, only exists because at these moments* I’m free of that pesky (yet positive) thing, evil? Okay, it’s bought. Sure, “evil” makes itself felt because it is an acting force, while happiness implies a culmination. But… But… Wow, you really thought this thing through…  Yes, I agree pain and suffering are implicit in life because they indivisibly linked with (how did you put it?) “necessities inseparable from life itself”, but this is all based on the single equation:                xE = xG (x = variable, E = evil, G = good)** Indulge me if you will, read on. Perhaps their nominal weights are not equal in proportion. Perhaps ten absolute values of evil are worth one good! Oh, how much more convincing your argument would be! If we valued good even less than we do now in proportion to evil! But, perhaps we value good  versus evil (through out the remainder of this brief letter I will the employ examples you illustrated your piece with, happiness and pain in this case) on a more weighted scale.  Briefly (yes, once again “H”*** is absolutely yelling at me to come dance with her), let us, arbitrarily of course, assign the absolute value of one smile from a pretty girl as, oh, let’s say, ten. In logic’s assumption, we would place a polar opposite action (stubbing your toe maybe) with the same absolute value. What if, in fact, the smile’s absolute value was more akin to getting in a bicycle accident? (Remember that story! No, it wasn’t that bad, but it did create much more pain than when I last stubbed the piggy that stayed home on the end table.) You could jab a sprig of will-o-wisp in your eye every twenty minutes if, in that time between, you managed to have a decent day. I see it coming. “You only value happiness with such a weighted scale because life is so miserably dull,” or, “You try not to anticipate happiness so that the dampening effects of that anticipation do not lessen the happy moment,” or, “You don’t know what you’re talking about.” Well, as for the first two, no. If it’s that hard to internally elaborate on this short epistle, you’re fucked and you deserve all the potential misery you heaped upon yourself, let alone others. As for the last, you can go hang. Sure, you make sense, and maybe when I was a bit more misanthropic, before my over-extended cynicism was demoted to mere maniacal cynicism, I would smile when I read****  this. One time this guy told me, “Every man takes the limits of his own field of vision for the limits of the world.” Tomato, tomato. I know all this will do is rile you up, but it’s not intended that way, honestly. I do wish I could elaborate more, but you know how it is… (Ha, maybe you don’t!) While I would like, and do intended (fully aware of my future failure to actualize this goal [a future failure in even intending at that]), to continue this line of thought at a latter date, we both know that won’t happen. If I were ever in the position to return, which would be do to lack of new stimuli and the inspiration to expound on them, then I would be much more susceptible to your point of view. A complete revision would destroy this thought. Well, take care, and write back soon. Bests, Josh.  * This is not a typo. Free your mind, think a bit looser. (Multiple moments, silly. Don’t assume linear thought!) ** This is a fault of human logic, assumptions. We assume that since these words “good” and “evil” assume polar opposition in literal terms, they also assume polar opposites in terms of the things they signify. The faultiness of human logical assessment can be expounded upon endlessly, but maybe some other time. I don’t wanna blow my load too soon. *** Happiness. **** To be read in the present tense.

      it's a good question. This new[?] possibilitism [my dear ulrich...] may just be enough. those eternal questionnaires of moral certainties will continue to be.  questions which, due to their subjective nature, forbade finite conclusions and decisive answers demand to be answered none the less. Oh, no fear, they will not go unsatiated. imaginations and advocates for the cloven one will keep it going, at least. fun and annoyance will dance waltzes this summer, serving to add their own presence to the worn paths. which [is it exploring if they've been there first? [oh no, subjectivism again]] may make it fun, surely engaging, to the babe's soft soles.  "it's not like jeopardy."
