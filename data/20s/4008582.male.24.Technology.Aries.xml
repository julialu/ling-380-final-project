       Nice one about punctuation, from Robert..  Welcome shakes for Jeeva, Raja Pandian, Robert, out_of_box [?!?! :)], Selvapraba..  Enjoy the day and lets share what we find fun and intresting..  today i found this one intresting::  The local bar was so sure that its bartender was the strongest man around that they offered a $1,000 bet. The bartender would squeeze a lemon until all the juice ran into a glass, and hand the lemon to a patron. Anyone who could squeeze one more drop of juice out would win the money. Many people like weightlifters, wrestlers, body builders, etc had tried over time, but nobody could do it.  One day this scrawny little man came in, wearing thick glasses and a safari suit, and said in a tiny, squeaky voice, "I'd like to try the bet." After the laughter had died down, the bartender said OK, grabbed a lemon, and squeezed away.  Then he handed the wrinkled remains of the rind to the little man. But the crowd's laughter turned to total silence as the man clenched his fist around the lemon and 5-6 drops fell into the glass.  As the crowd cheered, the bartender paid the $1,000, and asked the little man, "What do you do for a living? Are you a lumberjack, a weightlifter, or what?"  "No," replied the man. "I work as project manager for the IT company."

       Which of the following sentences is correct?   "I'll submit the report in a week time"&nbsp; or "I'll submit the report in a weeks time".&nbsp; Both are wrong. The correct sentence is&nbsp;"I'll submit the report in a week's time". Here is another example: "I'll submit the report in a month's/year's time".

       On July 20, 2004.. IP ver.6.0 released..   ICANN, the U.S. body overseeing Web site allocations globally, has launched a new technology that will allow virtually unlimited Internet addresses..  Internet Corp. for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) said the next-generation protocol, IPv6, had been added to its root server systems, making it possible for every person or device to have an Internet protocol address.  Rapid growth in the use of the World Wide Web has in recent times prompted concerns about future scarcity of domain addresses, with demand threatening to overload the existing system, the IPv4.  Los Angeles-based ICANN was given the job of overseeing the Internet's naming and numbering system globally by the U.S. government.  About two-thirds of the 4.3 billion Internet addresses currently available were used up, adding that IPv6 could magnify capacity by some "25,000 trillion trillion times".  IPv6 system would run parallel to IPv4 for about 20 years to ensure that any bugs or system errors were weeded out.   for more Info: http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/5467247/
