      hmm.. well hello.. i guess today was alright.. meh i'm still not feeling very happy.. it sucks quite a bit.. i went over to sukis with my brother to watch a movie.. we rented "Duplex" it was pretty good.. then we just hung out.. his little sister was being really nice to me.. and she gave me a hug.. twas odd.. meh.. then.. after that we went to pick up Rory from his girlfriends house.. i swear to god.. rory was jerking off in the car.. i could hear it.. but i didnt want to look.. i was in denial.. it was VERY strange.. ugh.. anyways i need to block that out of my memory right now. Umm okay its gone.. anyways.. hmm yeah.. then i got home.. went on the computer.. and guess what i'm still here.. god i'm so pathetic.. some person said my life was pathetic.. and told me i should go kill myself.. it was very nice.. heh.. yeah.. i'm somewhat tempted to take her advice.. but i probably don't have the guts to do it anymore.. oh well i guess thats a good thing.. hmmm so.. yeah.. thats all i wish i were drunk.. good day -lots of love and saliva, kira

      ugh.. depression.. it gnaws at your fucking soul.. and there's nothing you can do about it. everything is so fucked up.. i don't want to be here anymore.. it doesn't make any sense.. nothing does.. i just want to sleep and never wake up.. this world would probably be a better place without me.. its not like i contribute to it in any way.. i just use up resources.. I'm not useful in any way.. It's so sad when you have no one to talk to .. i can't relate to anyone.. i feel so alone.  I don't know what to do.. -sigh-.. oh well i'll sleep it off i guess..  goodbye.

      hey hey! what a day.. today was awesome.. it was STACEYS 16TH BIRTHDAY annnd midsummers eve.. it was great... stacey and i did so much.. we went to the mall and to the beach and celebrated midsummers eve.. it was darn fun!! So yes at the mall stacey had to buy a bathing suit.. and i had to run to roots and get us two shirts.. one says tree hugger (mine) and the other says happy camper (staceys) and they rule. After that my dad drove us to Gyro Park we laid in the sun... for a few hours.. and ate food... and tried going in the water but remembered we have a fear of jelly fish.. and there were two in there so we ran away..  We realized we were being watched by strange perverted men.. men whom we didnt KNOW!! anyways.. yeah.. they were creepy.. and they watched us as we were getting ready to go .. they were sitting on a bench.. DAMN MEN AND THEIR STUPIDNESS!! and yes.. after that we went and changed in the bathroom but i found that my bottle had somehow burst into a million pieces.. and everything was soaking wet in my bag.. soo i had to wear staceys shorts.. and yes.. it was poopy.. we also took pictures! after that we were sitting on a bench waiting for my dad to come.. there were these odd asian mafia dudes sitting behind us and one of them farted REALLY FUCKING LOUD.. and i wanted to yell .. "YOU'RE DISGUSTING" but i did not because i thought they might kill me.. annnnnnndd yesss... then we came back to my house and walked to get some chinese food which was darn good.. and then we went to catch the bus home.. and some strange dude said "nice ass" so i shook my fist at him and yelled "YOU BASTARD!!!!" and stacey and i just yelled at them.. then we came home.. and went out with candles at a blanket.. to celebrate midsummers even.. we put wax EVERYWHERE.. and thenn when it got dark we decided to walk back..  as we were walking back we took some cool pictures.. one was odd.. i think we took a picture of a ghost.. but yes.. thats about all we did today and it was AWESOME.. anyways.. im going to go watch lost in translation again.. gooday. -lots of love and saliva, kira

      Today was awesome.. a great way to end the school year and start the summer... stacey and i hung out.. I met her after school.. she bussed to my house and i met her down the street.. then we came back to my house.. we had to wait for my dad to get home so we could drive down to the zone radio station to pick up my movie pass i won to see Fahrenheit 9/11, we went to the park but the grass was too prickly so we came back to my house and decided to start watching Donnie Darko.. My dad came home.. it was SCORCHING hot today.. we went to the place and picked up the ticket.. i asked my dad to pick up some pizza.. soo we did..YAY.. and chocolate milk which was darn delicious.. we went to go pick up my mom at work.. there were these clouds coming in and it was starting to get really windy.. i kept thinking we were gonna have a twister.. lol so.. my dad went into the hotel to wait for my mom.. stacey and i were getting really over heated and delusional lol we were sitting in the car sweating and laughing sooo hard.. we started singing songs in opera voices.. and we sang the munchkins song from the wizard of oz movie..  and stacey was singing really really loud.. and this lady in the other car was looking at us.. and stacey blew her a kiss hahah.. there was this moth wing in the car.. and stacey and i were freaking out.. stacey like came over.. and she was holding me so tight lol it was soo funny.. i was like dying because it was sooo warm.. it was soo windy and stacey said there were ashes on her she said it looked like mount saint helen blew up lol so yeah we sat in the car for a half an hour laughing and talking.. yah .. it was fun.. then we came home.. and had pizza.. my family was fighting and i was getting all mad at them so stacey and i went upstairs.. We fell asleep on my bed for like an hour or so.. and when we woke up we were sooo hot.. cuz the door in my room was closed.. and we had no fan.. we were soo warm.. that we were just sitting there laughing.. i like fell on the floor laughing so hard.. i dont even remember what we were saying but it was sooo retarded.. we were so parched.. we were just lying on my bed.. stacey started like having a seizure hahahah it was sooo funny.. she was just twitching and hitting my bed hahah (she wasnt actually having a seizure) i got the hiccups really bad.. and i was like whimpering.. laughing.. dying and hiccuping all at the same time lol then we got some water.. and went outside and ran around in the hose and then we went to the park and laid in the grass.. which was darn funnn and there were some random guys like 20 feet away just smoking weed in the field.. it was funny "You think you know but you have no idea.. the diary of random guys" hahahah but yes.. hmm after that we came back to the house and watched the rest of donnie darko and thennn we walked to the hyacinth and sat around for a while talking about fate.. and sluts.. annd then w estarted getting attacked by bugs so we started walking home.. on the way down my street we saw something in the middle of the road that looked like a dead animal stacey was about to pass out.. so we started walking towards it.. and we were scared that it was a cat.. we were right in front of it.. and it still looked like a dead animal.. so then i wanted to figure what it was so i started going towards it.. stacey decided to come with me even though she was so freaked out.. i was worried it was a cat.. whcih is why i wanted to see it.. cuz if it was someones cat i wanted to tell them.. we neared it.. and then.. it was a branch.. hahaha we were laughing so hard.. but seriously it actually looked like a dead animal from afar.. it looked like it had legs a tail and a head and fur and everyone.. it was also dark.. and maybe we spent too long in the sun today.. but it was the scariest thing ever.. but yes.. we took a piece of the branch to put into our scrap book.. that shall be started soon enough.. anyways.. that ended our day.. staceys still here.. but shes going home in a few mins.

      hello.. so.. its 2 in the morning.. i can't stop thinking about.. "relationships" and how i'm so afraid of commitment.. It's really hard.. when you can't express yourself properly.. I feel really vulnerable when i tell someone how i feel.. which is why i dont do it.. i feel like if i dont.. it wont hurt so bad when it doesn't work out which is stupid i know but its how i feel.. it seems like relationships are really pointless.. when i know it will never turn out right anyways.. I'll always get hurt.. no matter what. Guys always seem nice in the beginning and i feel like they're like that just so they can get what they want.. when they have it.. they don't want it so much anymore.. I guess im really pessimistic about the whole thing.. but its hard for me to think any other way .. when every other "relationship" i've been in has turned out VERY bad.. I haven't really been treated well by men.. so its a scarey place for me to be when once again i know theres a possibility that im going to get fucked over... man i make no sense.. im just an idiot.. i need to sleep.. i hope jem gets a job tomorrow. anyways im off to bed.. night night -lots of love and saliva, kira

      Yah so, as the title explains.. I got ditched again.. Which fucking sucks.. So yah.. I'm bored. I don't even know why I'm writing.. I guess its because I have nothing better to do anyways. Bleh.. So.. I think that spider laid spider eggs in my bathroom because last night there were two baby spiders crawling on me.. And when I was in the shower there was another one crawling on the shower curtain.. My house is infested with bugs.. Its pretty disgusting.. I don't even want to imagine how many bugs I could have eaten in my sleep... oy.. Gross.. But yah.. sooo.. What to do today.. Guess I'll just watch finding nemo or something.. Or go back to bed one or the other.. mmhmm! Life is grand.. Yep yep.. Okay I'm going now.. C-ya -lots of love and saliva, kira

      Well.. Okay so I transferred all my stuff onto this.. Because I'm sick of my layout.. And I need some change.. At the moment i'm talking to good ol jem.. He's the coolest guy ever.. And stacey is the coolest girl ever.. Well today was a boring day.. I went tanning.. And then I came home.. And pretty much just talked to jem, then I had to go to the doctor.. I was having some major chest pains.. And yesterday I had an anxiety attack.. I went to the hospital but the emergency was way to busy.. Darn nabit.. So I went home and I still thought I was going to die.. The doctor I spoke too today prescribed me with some pills and told me I should get some counseling and learn some breathing techniques. But yes.. That was my day.. Now IM sitting here... Still talking to jem.. Damn we talk a lot.. And yeah.. I'm hoping its sunny tomorrow so I can be happier.. And that is all good day -lots of love and saliva, kira

If I could offer you only one tip for the future, sunscreen would be it. The long term benefits of sunscreen have been proved by scientists whereas the rest of my advice has no basis more reliable than my own meandering experience I will dispense this advice now. Enjoy the power and beauty of your youth; oh nevermind; you will not understand the power and beauty of your youth until they have faded. But trust me, in 20 years you’ll look back at photos of yourself and recall in a way you can’t grasp now how much possibility lay before you and how fabulous you really looked. You’re not as fat as you imagine.   Don’t worry about the future; or worry, but know that worrying is as effective as trying to solve an algebra equation by chewing bubblegum. The real troubles in your life are apt to be things that never crossed your worried mind; the kind that blindside you at 4pm on some idle Tuesday.   Do one thing everyday that scares you   Sing Don’t be reckless with other people’s hearts, don’t put up with people who are reckless with yours.   Floss   Don’t waste your time on jealousy; sometimes you’re ahead, sometimes you’re behind the race is long, and in the end, it’s only with yourself.   Remember the compliments you receive, forget the insults; if you succeed in doing this, tell me how.   Keep your old love letters, throw away your old bank statements.   Stretch   Don’t feel guilty if you don’t know what you want to do with your life the most interesting people I know didn’t know at 22 what they wanted to do with their lives, some of the most interesting 40 year olds I know still don’t.   Get plenty of calcium. Be kind to your knees, you’ll miss them when they’re gone.   Maybe you’ll marry, maybe you won’t, maybe you’ll have children, maybe you won’t, maybe you’ll divorce at 40, maybe you’ll dance the funky chicken on your 75th wedding anniversary what ever you do, don’t congratulate yourself too much or berate yourself either your choices are half chance, so are everybody else’s. Enjoy your body, use it every way you can don’t be afraid of it, or what other people think of it, it’s the greatest instrument you’ll ever own..   Dance even if you have nowhere to do it but in your own living room. Read the directions, even if you don’t follow them. Do NOT read beauty magazines, they will only make you feel ugly. Get to know your parents, you never know when they’ll be gone for good.   Be nice to your siblings; they are the best link to your past and the people most likely to stick with you in the future.   Understand that friends come and go, but for the precious few you should hold on. Work hard to bridge the gaps in geography in lifestyle because the older you get, the more you need the people you knew when you were young.   Live in New York City once, but leave before it makes you hard; live in Northern California once, but leave before it makes you soft.   Travel.   Accept certain inalienable truths, prices will rise, politicians will philander, you too will get old, and when you do you’ll fantasize that when you were young prices were reasonable, politicians were noble and children respected their elders.   Respect your elders.   Don’t expect anyone else to support you. Maybe you have a trust fund, maybe you have a wealthy spouse; but you never know when either one might run out.   Don’t mess too much with your hair, or by the time you're 40, it will look 85.   Be careful whose advice you buy, but, be patient with those who supply it. Advice is a form of nostalgia, dispensing it is a way of fishing the past from the disposal, wiping it off, painting over the ugly parts and selling it for more than it’s worth.

       Sometimes I get the feeling That I won't be on this planet for very longI really like it here I'm quite attached to it; I hope I'm wrong.      All I really want to say You're the reason I want to stayI loved you before I met you And I met you just in time Because there was nothing left.      I sat here on my suitcase In our empty new apartment 'til the sun went downAnd I walked back down the stairs With all my bags and drove away You must be freaking out.      All I know is I got to be Where my heart says I ought to beIt often makes no sense, in fact I never understand these things I feel.      Don't change your plans for me I won't move to LA The leaves are falling back east That's where I'm going to stay.      You have made me smile again In fact I might be sore from it It's been awhileI know we've been together Many times before I'll see you on the other side      All I really want to say You're the reason I want to stay But destiny is calling And I told them when my time is up I'm out of here      All I know is I got to be Where my heart says I ought to be It often makes no sense, in fact I never understand these things I feel      I love you, good bye   I love you, good bye

I feel so alone today.. i didn't get outside once.&nbsp; Sometimes i just feel like i wanna be with someone.. i miss cuddles and kisses and all that fun stuff.. I just miss being wanted.&nbsp; It's depressing... the bluenotes people haven't called me yet so i'm a little worried that i probably didnt get hired,&nbsp; Which would probably just make me feel worse.. meh i'm too lazy to write.. im gonna go clean my room and have a shower.. goodbye. -lots of love and saliva, kira

I guess you might not want to read it all so download it.. anyways today was a great day.. it was scorching hot .. i went down to value village with zea and jodi.. it was alright except for i was dying.. but i guess today was one of those memorable days that really don't mean anything at all.. but for some reason you remember them.. i love leisurely days.. when its scorching hot outside.. and the ground is steaming and all you do is sit there or read.. or sleep.. its great.. my dad bought pizza and popsicles and fudgesicles and juice to cool us all down.. then my little brother and i sat around outside while i read and listened to music.. and we sorta talked.. then we went and played some basketball with all the little kids in my complex.. we did that tfor a couple of hours.. running around giving them plane rides and doing "wash the dishes dry the dishes turn the dishes over!" One girl kept on making me give her plane rides and i got so dizzy and i gave so many horsie rides and piggy back rides.. -phew- i think i sweat quite a bit.. i'm going to go have a luke warm shower in a few minutes and get off to bed because i have to babysit at 7:30 in the morning.. Summer school is almost over.. and i'm somewhat sad.. and somewhat glad.. i will miss certain people and we'll probably never hang out with again.. and some people i won't miss.. for instance.. alex.. because he's not nice to me bah i would have liked to get to know people better but i guess tis too late i have this little project thing to do this weekend.. well not little its worth 7 percent of my grade which i need because.. if i dont get it i will most likely fail this course because i only have 60 percent.. i'm very worried i wont pass.. ugh.. its stressful.. i just wish i were a kid sometimes.. it was all so much easier back then.. running around in bare feet.. swimming in random neighbours pools.. playing with random kids you didnt know.. it was so simple.. getting stung by a bee was the worst part of your day.. it's sad now that i know that soon i have to grow up.. become an "adult" be "mature" have no imagination.. i wish i could go to never never land.. everything would be just grand there and i could live with peter pan.. but i guess i'm too old for that now eh..? yeah its sad.. well anyways.. i am off bye bye all you non existant readers (except for stacey who always read and whom i love dearly -hug-) bye bye!  -lots of love and saliva, kira

      Well today was an alright day. I went to school.. the morning was hell because it was raining like death.. i was standing at the bus stop with my hood on screaming "WHY GOD?! WHY!?! WHY DO YOU HATE ME!" i think people were wondering if i was retarded.. meh oh well.. soo i went to school saw the cool hippie with no shoes.. and met some crazies from sooke.. they made me smell trees.. umm i got really good marks in class today so i was proud except for some kid was spitting spit balls at me and some other guy.. it was really angering and i felt like crying .. but umm yes.. then it got really sunny and i bussed home.. and then i played with my new cat.. i named her Peko.. and then i played with Sasha because she was jealous.. and then i feel asleep for about an hour or so.. and stacey called waking me up telling me she was coming over.. we went to the ball park and got some onion rings and candy and the onion rings WERE GOD! Ugh.. im craving some now.. i was just stuffing my face. I love stacey she always makes me feel better.. then we went for a walk on the trail and took some pictures.. and then we went to the park by my house and started digging at some thing we think is a dead body.. we are going back some other day to keep digging.. because we only had sticks. Man we are so easily amused. Anyways.. i should probably hit the sack.. gotta get up early once again.. 17 more days of this hell. Bye bye

       Narcissistic personality disorder is characterized by self-centeredness. They tend to be choosy about picking friends, since they believe that not just anyone is worthy of being their friend. They tend to make good first impressions, yet have difficulty maintaining long-lasting relationships. They are generally uninterested in the feelings of others and may take advantage of them.   People with schizoid personality disorder avoid relationships and do not show much emotion. They genuinely prefer to be alone and do not secretly wish for popularity. They tend to seek jobs that require little social contact. Their social skills are often weak and they do not show a need for attention or acceptance. They are perceived as humorless and distant and often are termed "loners."    Sounds alot like me now doesnt it?

      Well hello.. i spent most of my night crying in my room.. listening to stupid cheesy love songs and trying to get my parents to stop coming in wondering what was wrong with me.. i think i cried for about 2 hours and my excuse was "I'm pmsing what do you expect" I think i'm becoming a good liar.. I seem to lie alot to my parents now.. it really sucks.. i  am  pmsing.. but normally it doesn't really affect me.. i guess it may have had more of an affect than most night.. Because i haven't cried that much in quite some time.. i'm hurting so bad right now. And i'm so stressed.. i think i need to see a psychiatrist.. maybe get my ass back on some stupid anti depressants.. so i can be "normal" yeah that would be good.. I'd rather be fake and numb then sad.. and dead inside..  I have to get up at 9 tomorrow.. i have an appointment at the clinic to get my fun birth control shot.. I don't even need it.. but i guess its good .. i hate getting my rag anyways.. bah i have a headache goodbye

      Well today was a memorable canada day.. i went over to staceys house this morning to go up island to parksville.. we waited around for a while.. and then we started off on the long drive there.. it took a while because we had to make so many stops.. we stopped at liquidation world.. and i bought some stuff for my room for super cheap and i bought a sweater for $7.99 yeah good buys.. i need to go to Liquidation world more often.. Anyways after that we drove for hours and we finally made it.. Stacey and i walked around a bit.. some stupid guys tried hitting on us but i gave them the finger.. ugh so stupid.. and then we went and walked out to this little island.. but i got scared because the tide was coming in (i have stupid bad experiences with ocean water lol) anyways after that stacey and i just basked in the sun.. and then we realized it was 4 30.. and we had to meet some people downtown at 8.. so we ate quickly.. and went the long drive home.. we came home.. got changed.. and went straight downtown.. it was pretty fun.. we met up with maria meike lea talia.. annd some other people.. and walked around for a bit.. we watched some cool acrobats.. it was fun.. and then stacey chased around emo kids with her camera then i decided to go into the fountain in front of the parliment buildings because stacey said she would give me hot chocolate if i did.. and Leah joined me.. and yes it was cold.. but no problem at all.. annd zen hmm what else.. we umm.. did shtuff.. and then we watched the fire works.. and there were these amusing drunk dudes from ireland.. and we got a picture with them.. then we wandered around downtown after the fireworks.. i saw jem by some bar with people.. so i hid and ran away because i didnt want to embaress him.. and then stacey and i went home.. and that was my day..  -lots of love and saliva, Kira

      Hey hey.. i haven't posted in a while. mostly because nothing interesting has happened .. and it still hasn't lol I've been inside for 4 or 5 days now i've only gone out twice and that was too see a doctor for my  ugly wart and get it burned off and to get an ultrasound too see why im oh so sick all the time.. getting the ultrasound was painful because you have to hold your pee.. and drink 4 big glasses of water an hour or so before you go.. and she kept on pressing on my tummy ugh.. but it was sad because a lady there went to get an ultrasound and she found out she had a miscarriage.. and she was all crying and so was her boyfriend/husband..  tis sad..  umm but yes stacey is coming home from lawn bowling tonight!! And i'm excited.. i hope she wins.. because if she does she wins a new set of bowls that she's probably g onna sell for like 500$ which is quite a bit of money.. she says when she gets back that she's gonna "wine and dine me" lol she's my dream date..  oh by the way.. for people reading this.. stacey and i ARE NOT DATING lol silly people.. anyways.. im going to go find some food.. have a nice evening.. bye bye -lots of love and saliva, kira
