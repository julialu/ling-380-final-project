To  urlLink Love  you is to cherish the warmth of your arms, the sweetness of your kiss, the friendliness of your smile, the loving sound in your voice, and the happiness we share. To  urlLink Love  you is to never forget the adversity we have overcome, the tears we have shed, the plans we have made, the problems we have solved, and the pain of separation. To  urlLink Love  you is to remember joyfully the days we made memorable, the moments that will live forever in our hearts, the dreams we hope for, the feelings we have for each other, the caresses and touches of  urlLink Love , and the exhilaration of  urlLink love  that fills our hearts. To  urlLink Love  you is to need you, want you, hold you, and know you as no one else can. To  urlLink Love  you is to realize that life without you would be no life at all... That's a little of what it's like to be in  urlLink Love  with you...  &nbsp; »»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»» Jß JªÑ ««««««««««««««««««««««««««««  &nbsp;

           »»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»» Jß JªÑ ««««««««««««««««««««««««««««  When I think of my past  urlLink love  which is you, I may view it as a failure but I tried. And if I find a new  urlLink love , I view the past as a teacher. In the game of  urlLink love , to me, it doesn't really matter who won or who lost. What is important is I know when to hold on and when to let go… Have I?…   I know I really  urlLink love  someone when I want him to be happy, even if his happiness means that I’m not part of it. Everything happens for the best. If the person I  urlLink love  doesn't  urlLink love  me back, I will try not to be afraid to  urlLink love  someone else again, for I’ll never know unless I give it a try. I’ll never  urlLink love  a person I  urlLink love  unless I risk for  urlLink love . But the question is… Will I be able to  urlLink love  that person the way I loved you?…    urlLink Love  strives in hurting. If I don't get hurt, I don't learn how to  urlLink love .  urlLink Love  doesn't hurt all the  urlLink time . Though the hurting is still there to  urlLink test  me, to help me grow. Don't find  urlLink love , let  urlLink love  find me. That's why it's called falling in  urlLink love  because I don’t force myself to fall. I just fall… But why you want me to force myself to fall for someone I don’t love?…   I cannot finish a book without closing it's chapters. If I want to go on, then I have to leave the past as I turn the pages.  urlLink Love  is not destroyed by a  urlLink single  failure or won by a  urlLink single  caress. It is a lifetime venture in which we are always  urlLink learning , discovering and growing. I am… The greatest irony of  urlLink love  is letting you go when I need to hold on and holding on when I need to let you go. We lose someone we  urlLink love  only when we are destined to find someone else who can  urlLink love  us even more than we can  urlLink love  ourselves. But still, to me, destiny has always been in my hands for me to create a better tomorrow for us… I don’t depend on destiny… I allow destiny to depend on me to create my own hope for a better tomorrow...   On falling out of  urlLink love , it takes some  urlLink time  to heal and then I get back on the bus. But I tried not to make the same mistake of boarding the same one that alighted me the first  urlLink time . But I did it out of Love…   To  urlLink love  is to risk rejection, to live is to risk dying, to hope is to risk failure. To believe is to risk miracles. But all this risk must be taken because the greatest hazard in life is risk nothing! To reach for you is to risk involvement and commitment, to expose my feelings is to expose my true self towards you which I had and to  urlLink love  you, is to risk not to be loved in return…  How to define love: fall but do not stumble, be constant but not too persistent, share and never be unfair, understanding you and try not to demand, hurt but never keep the pain which I am still trying…  urlLink Love  is like a knife. It can stab my heart or it can carve wonderful images into my soul that always last for a lifetime. Or in memories of years…    urlLink Love  is supposed to be the most wonderful feeling. It should inspire me and give me joy and strength. But sometimes the things that gave me joy can also hurt me in the end. Loving you means giving you the freedom who you choose to be and where you choose to be. For all the heartaches and the tears, for gloomy days and fruitless years, I should give thanks, for I know, that there were the things that helped me grow.   Loving you means giving you the freedom to find your way and for me to be patient while you are doing your findings.Whether it leads towards me or away from me.  urlLink Love  is a painful risk to take but the risk must be taken no matter how scary or painful it is to me, for only then I’ll experience the fullness of humanity and that is love…   Only  urlLink love  can hurt my heart, fill me with desire and tear me apart. Only  urlLink love  can make me cry and only  urlLink love  knows why. If I’m not ready to cry, if I’m not ready to take the risk, if I’m not ready to feel the pain, then I’m not ready to  urlLink love .   There was a  urlLink time  in my life when I became afraid to fall in  urlLink love , you gave me the confident to  urlLink love  and  urlLink trust  you… I thank you… But now you know why I became afraid to  urlLink love  before you came and filled my world with love? Coz every  urlLink time  I do, just like now… I get hurt, then I figured it out… that's why I had to let you go for good… Tough it really hurts to let you go… But do I have a choice? I had… But did you give me one?… Sad to say… No…  »»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»» Jß JªÑ ««««««««««««««««««««««««««««

True Love is built upon complete trust - complete by knowing that you can never be deceitful or misleading, because to do so would forever cloud the relationship with doubt.       True Love is knowing that you'd rather be with this other person than with anyone else, and you feel a sense of emptiness when the two of you are apart...        It's when you always think of the future in terms of "we" instead of "me".       True Love is treasuring the touch of the other person while feeling a sense of contentment and completeness as you emotinally and physically embrace.       True Love is wanting to make the other person happy and fulfilled in every possible way while doing everything you can to prevent their distress...       True Love is a commitment to working out the differences that will&nbsp; always come about when two people become one.       It is knowing that life will bring pain and sorrow, but together, you will support each other and overcome even the most difficult times.        True Love is showing and saying "I LoveYou" even when you both know - through a simple smile - that doing so isn't necessary.        True Love is complete within itself, and it lasts into Eternity...     »»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»» Jß JªÑ ««««««««««««««««««««««««««««   &nbsp;

A friend of mine asked me this question, "If there is a  urlLink time  machine to bring you back to the past, where do you want to go back to?" I thought for a while and I didn't say anything and this friend of mine said this, "I think you would want to go back when you and him are still together right?" I just nodded my head... Than I again, and told this firned of my that I might want to go back to the past before I knew him so life wouldn't be so empty for me right now... But stil... If I was able to go back to the past, I wish... But is it ever possible... I guess not... I was really happy for my  urlLink friends  when I came to know that they have found their bus(happiness) but than again... I began to wonder... A friend of mine waited for 9 months for her to board that bus she has always wanted to... ANd it was worth waiting for it... I cried upon recieving the  urlLink news  froom her... Not only because I was really happy for her... Its also because I really wonder... And since than... Don't know why... I begin to ask myself all the  urlLink time ... "Will I be able to wait till that day comes?"... I just wonder... &nbsp; »»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»» Jß JªÑ ««««««««««««««««««««««««««««
