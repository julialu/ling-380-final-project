      Dodgeball was good fun. If you're in a good mood, then go see it.   The movie is short so it is ADD friendly.     Later.

      No not the links at a golf course. I hate golf. And tiger woods. Noticed I spelled his name with lower case. Oops. This blog is for the creation of link land. Link land is going to give you grewat links to other websites. I wanted a forum for me to use the blog this! feature of the google toolbar.   I invite anyone to give links and comments in the comment section. Polls will be added soon. I want to stress the fact that I am not making any money off of these sites. I am tired of wondering where all the good sites are. When I hear about a good site or see one in a magazine my computer is never near.   So sit back and click a few links.   Later
