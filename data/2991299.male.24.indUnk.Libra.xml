      Friday again!:D:D:D This week surely went by very very fast.............Have made up my mind to intensify my workouts........... Need to add some cardio workouts also........just situps and stuff will stop working after some time......... I dont believe in the "dieting" way of losing weight..........used to think it will be easier than exercising......but cant stay away from good food!:D:D realized that exercising is a better way......have lost a good 2 inches on the waist in the past 4 months..........so things are looking good! hope to lose some more by august!! lets see................

      Living all by yourself, in a foreign land, with no close friends within a 40 mile radius can sound like a lot of pain!!! But I have realised that its not that bad after all.........of course, it would be great with people around, but nonetheless.......its not too bad......... I think my attitude to life has changed in the past few months.........I have never felt more independent, confident and eager for more, ever before........I have also learnt the value of friends and family........and how i always took them for granted...........I think I have learnt to live life.......not just go through each day............... Friday.........the end of the week.........AHA! planning to go to this huge outlet mall near NYC.......called Woodbury Commons...........it supposedly the "shopping attraction" for tourists on the east coast...........some 200 odd shops with all the brands u need.........GAP is a sure-shot destination..........Maybe the LEVIS store and the NIKE store.............I hope there is a SONY store too............. Till next time..............ADIOS AMHI GOES..............

      Was reading the Gita online.......(english translation)............Krishna says that every man is given a set of tasks in his life....which he has to perform.........that is the only way to the "ultimate truth".............................  then, come to think of it.........Gautam Buddha left his wife and child in search of the "truth"......which means that he neglected his duties.............then how did he find the "eternal truth" and the "inner peace"??? is the "truth" different for buddhism and hinduism??? mebbe im not interpreting things correctly..........mebbe i need to just read between the lines some more............... Puzzling..........  Well...........i am kind of looking forward to the next "set of duties" for me to fulfill ;) ........but am started to get a little jittery too.................it might be the end of my LIFE&nbsp;that I CURRENTLY am living............  more later..........

      Over the weekend, i had been to an outlet mall called the Woodbury Commons. It had the most amazing collection of designer brands that i have ever seen, and that too at a "reduced" price (which was anyways too high). BUT - why do MOST of the designer clothes for guys look so GAY????? Cant normal, straight guy-next-door guys wear clothes other than your routine jeans and tshirts, and NOT LOOK GAY?????? May be its the way im looking at those clothes.....but i think theres definitely room for improvement here............ till later........ciao
