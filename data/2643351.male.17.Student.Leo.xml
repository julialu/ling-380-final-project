      If you drained Boca Resavouir(however that is spelt) how much money would be there.  How many Pennies?  How many nickels?  How many Dimes?  How many quarters?  How many 50 cent pieces?  How many dollar pieces?  How many Susan Bs?  How many cows?  How many gold coins?  How many sunken ships?  How many pesos?  Well that was just a random thought I had at Boca today.

      Well today I went to help Timmy with his car.  His battery died.  I went in there with the battery and was going to act stupid.  And say  Hey can I get a refill, do you just refill it with joules or calories, or does it really matter.  Which would you perfer to fill it with, it sure doesn't make a difference to me.  So what ever you want unless one is cheaper.

You must be the real reason for global warming.”  “Is there an airport nearby or is that just my heart taking off?”  “If I could rearrange the alphabet, I’d put U and I together.”   "Did it hurt...when you fell to Earth from Heaven?"   Do your feet hurt,... cus you have been running through my mind all day
