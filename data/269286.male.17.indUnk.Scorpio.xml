       Well I arrived in hel... err Mississippi today about 3:30.  What a boring ride.  At least I got to watch Dodgeball on the way down.  Now, I guess I just sit around on 56k for the next few days.  I think tomorrow we are going to eat at some good place in Jackson.... sadly it has a gay name, Cock of the Walk.  See, told you it was gay.  Anyway, back to watching Barbershop 2 for me.

Soon I should have my laptop back up and there might even be a laptop cam coming :) .  Don't expect anything to be done until Tuesday or Wednesday as I will be in Mississippi until late afternoon Monday.  I may get to post down there if I can get the 56k (ugh) working.

       I had to wake up eaaaaaarly as hell to go to work at EIGHT IN THE MORNING.  8 am and Ryan Glenn should never be in the same sentence.  Well I get there and I walk in and all the sudden I hear this little humming noise.. I look around, like WTF?  They installed this annoying ass security camera.  It moves any time is sees movement. SOOO it moves all the time and gets on my nerves after about five minutes.  After I get home, I tried to format my computer.  DAMN I'm UNLUCKY!!!!!!  It took me forever, but I finally put Windows XP Home Edition on it. yay.
