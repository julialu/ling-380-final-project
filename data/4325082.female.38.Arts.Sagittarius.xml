      So today is the kind of day where I'm really tempted to have a meltdown. People yelling at me for things they don't even understand, people being mean, and on top of it all a gloomy day. But it's not worth it to have a meltdown. Perhaps the best thing is to sit down with a fine whine and some aged sheeze.

      Welcome to my space to overanalzye, process and scribe what's around and inside me. Enjoy.
