      day two  ... thank you sweet caffeine for helping me get through this ...   its not that the course is boring, but were a big group, and the class stops every 2 minutes ... this makes the course appear twice as long as it's supposed to be ... :-(  can't wait for the break ...

      and i thought that the olympic games would make the calls go away ... unfortunately not .... :-(  today is the last day taking calls for the next 3 weeks .... i was not able to escape my fate of becoming a cable-tv tech support as well as internet tech, so they send me in formation ...  i just hope that Fannie gives the class :-)
